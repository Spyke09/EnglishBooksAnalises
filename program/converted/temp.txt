 CHAPTER
 ONE:
 THE
 FARM 
 
I GREW
 UP ON FELISTER
'S FARM,
 THAT
 SICK
 BASTARD
 SADIST
 WHO
 COULD
 DO NOTHING
 BUT
 CASTRATE
 PIGS.
 AND
 THEY
 PAID
 HIM
 TOO
 WELL
 TO CASTRATE
 THEM.
 IMAGINE
 THE
 LITTLE
 PINK
 ANIMALS
 AND
 THE
 PERVERTED
 FELISTER
 WHO
 LONGED
 TO TAKE
 AWAY
 THE
 LITTLE
 DANGLING
 PINK
 LEATHER
 BALLS
 HANGING
 BETWEEN
 THEIR
 HOOVES.
 HE ALSO
 HAD
 TO DEAL
 WITH
 SOME
 SPECIFIC
 PROBLEMS
 LIKE
 SORES
 OR INGUINAL
 HERNIAS,
 AND
 THAT
 GENERALLY
 REQUIRED
 A CERTAIN
 MEDICAL
 KNOWLEDGE.
 AND
 HIS
 FAVORITE
 TIME
 TO PERFORM
 THIS
 SERIOUS
 MANIPULATION
 WAS
 EARLY
 IN THE
 MORNING. 
HOW
 HE JUST
 ENJOYED
 THEIR
 SCREAMS.
 IT'S
 STRANGE
 WHEN
 YOU
 HAVE
 TO LIVE
 IN SUCH
 A REALITY.
  LITTLE
 BY LITTLE
 YOU
 LEARN
 TO BE ANOTHER
 PERSON!
 AND
 YOU
 BEGIN
 TO UNDERSTAND
 WHY
 THEY
 CONSIDER
 PIGS
 YOUR
 BROTHERS! 
FELISTER,
 WHO
 RAISED
 AND
 FED
 THEM,
 CAREFULLY
 OBSERVED
 THEIR
 BEHAVIOR
 AND
 THE
 MANIFESTATIONS
 OF CERTAIN
 ACTIONS,
 AS HE CALLED
 THEM
 - LEFT
 TO THEIR
 OWN
 DEVICES,
 THEIR
 LEADERSHIP
 HIERARCHY
 WAS
 SIMPLE
 AND
 OBVIOUS,
 BUT
 IN CONFINED
 SPACES
 THINGS
 CHANGED
 - THE
 STRONGER
 ONES
 DOMINATED
 THE
 WEAKER
 ONES
 AND
 CONSEQUENTLY
 RECEIVED
 MORE
 BENEFITS
 SUCH
 AS FOOD AND
 TREATMENT.
 IN BETWEEN,
 BY THE
 WAY,
 I NOW
 REMEMBER
 THAT
 FEW
 COULD
 APPRECIATE
 THE
 PIG'S
 NATURE
 WITH
 DIGNITY.
 PIGS
 WERE
 INDIVIDUALS
 AND
 EACH
 DEALT
 WITH
 THE
IR PROBLEMS
 IN THEIR
 OWN
 WAY.
 THE
 PIG
 WAS
 OMNIVOROUS,
 IT COULD
 HIDE
 IN ITS
 CAMOUFLAGE
 OF 9 
 SLIME,
 WAITING
 FOR
 AN OPPORTUNE
 MOMENT
 TO POP
 OUT
 OF ITS
 HIDING
 PLACE
 AND
 GO ON THE
 ATTACK.
 IT WAS
 UNDOUBTEDLY
 A STRATEGIST
 - OR RATHER
 A TACTICIAN
 - AND
 OCCUPIED
 THE
 TOP OF THE
 FOOD CHAIN
 OR THE
 TOP
 OF THE
 PYRAMID
 IN LIFE
 - OR SO IT THOUGHT.
 MOST
 WARS
 IN HUMAN
 HISTORY
 HAVE
 BEEN
 FOUGHT
 BY PIGS,
 MOST
 EMPIRES
 HAVE
 BEEN
 RULED
 BY PIGS,
 AND
 SOMETIMES
 PIGS
 HAVE
 BEEN
 NOMENCLATURES
 - PIG
 BUSINESS
 IN GENERAL.
 ONLY
 THE
 WORLD
 AND
 LIFE WERE
 CHANGING
 AND
 MOVING
 ON UNSTOPPABLY,
 AND
 THE
 ILLUSION
 OF A BLUE
 SPRING
 CREATED
 BY EMPTY
 PROMISES
 OF DROWNING
 MEN COULD
 NOT
 COMPENSATE
 FOR THE
 HARSH
 REALITY!
 THIS
 SYSTEM
 WAS
 SIMPLY
 DOOMED
 TO PERISH!
  FELISTER
 WAS
 A VERY
 PECULIAR
 SORT
 OF MAN
 - GLOOMY
 AND
 SUBDUED!
 SO LOATHSOME,
 YET
 BEWITCHING!
 AS IF HE COULD
 ONLY
 EXIST
 IN THIS
 DIM
 REALITY
 WHICH
 HE CONTROLLED
 WITH
 A SKILFUL
 HAND! 

THE
 PROCEDURE
 OF CASTRATING
 THE
 PIGS
 WAS
 SOMEWHAT
 TEDIOUS,
 BUT
 FELISTER
 DID
 HIS
 WORK
 WITH
 DUE CARE
 AND DILIGENCE-THERE
 WERE
 SO MANY
 ANIMALS
 TO BE SERVED
 BY HIS
 EXPERIENCED
 HAND
 HOLDING
 THE
 CASTRATION
 APPARATUS.
 PIG-KEEPING
 ITSELF
 WAS
 AN EXCELLENT
 AND
 LUCRATIVE
 BUSINESS! 
I DID
 NOT
 THINK
 I SHOULD
 EVER HAVE
 COME
 HERE-THIS
 PLACE
 HAD
 STRANGE
 TRADITIONS,
 AND
 MANY
 OF THE
 MOST
 INTELLIGENT
 PEOPLE
 HAD
 DECLARED
 TO CLOSE
 IT FOR
 A NUMBER
 OF REASONS.
 BUT WHAT
 TO DO?
 THE
 MORE
 TIME
 I SPENT
 HERE
 I BECAME
 CONVINCED
 THAT
 SOMETHING
 SEEMED
 TO BE WRONG...
 THE
 DAYS
 PASSED
 TOO MONOTONOUSLY
 AND
 THERE
 WAS
 ENOUGH
 WORK
 TO GET
 CAUGHT
 UP IN TRYING
 TO ESCAPE
 REALITY! 
10  FELISTER
 WAS
 NO EGOTIST,
 AND
 WOULD
 OCCASIONALLY
 FILL
 US IN ON SOME
 OF THE
 INTRICACIES
 OF HIS
 CRAFT
 - AND
 THEY
 WERE
 NOT
 FEW. 
ONE
 CHANGES
 WITH
 TIME.
 AND
 LOOKING
 AT THE
 POOR
 ANIMALS
 I BECAME
 MORE
 AND MORE
 CONVINCED
 THAT
 THIS
 WAS
 MY REFUGE
 FROM
 THE
 OUTSIDE
 WORLD. 
IN A VERY
 STRANGE
 WAY
 I HAD
 ENDED
 UP HERE,
 AND
 NOW
 I WAS
 CLEARLY
 AWARE
 THAT
 SOONER
 OR LATER
 I WOULD
 HAVE
 TO GET
 OUT
 - THE
 QUESTION
 WAS
 EXACTLY
 HOW
 I WAS
 GOING
 TO DO IT. 
BUT FELISTER
 SHOWED
 ABSOLUTELY
 NO PREJUDICE
 AS TO HIS
 OCCUPATIONS
 - AND
 HE HARDLY
 CARED
 MUCH
 AS LONG
 AS HE GOT
 HIS
 MONEY'S
 WORTH
 FOR
 HIS
 NOT
 VERY
 DIFFICULT
 WORK. 
ALL
 SORTS
 OF PEOPLE
 CAME
 AND
 WENT,
 BUT
 THE
 WORK
 WAS
 THE
 SAME
 - MONOTONOUS
 AND
 FULL
 OF A CERTAIN
 AMOUNT
 OF TENSION. 
FELISTER
 EMBANKS
 REALISED
 THAT
 HE WAS
 UNLIKELY
 TO DO THE
 SAME
 THING
 ALL
 HIS
 LIFE,
 BUT
 AS THEY
 USED
 TO SAY
 AT MY END,
 HE PRETENDED
 NOT
 TO CARE. 
PLUS,
 IN THIS
 CRISIS
 AND
 WITH
 THE
 HUGE
 UNEMPLOYMENT,
 HE HAD
 TO BE HAPPY
 IN THIS
 JOB
 TOO. 

I MIGHT
 HAVE
 MENTIONED
 THAT
 I DIDN'T
 HAVE
 TOO MANY
 FRIENDS
 WHEN
 I WAS
 GROWING
 UP.
  I GREW
 UP IN THE
 POOR
 SOUTHERN
 SUBURBS
 OF A LARGE
 METROPOLIS
 IN THE
 STATE
 OF MISSOURI
 ABOUT
 THIRTY-FIVE
 OR FORTY
 MILES
 FROM
 FELISTER
'S FARM. 
WHEN
 I WAS
 YOUNG,
 I HAD
 STRANGE
 VISIONS,
 AND
 AFTER
 A WHILE
 THE
 EVENTS
 OF MY LIFE
 BEGAN
 TO OCCUR
 IN A STRANGE
 SEQUENCE
 THAT
 WAS
 GENERALLY
 COMPLETELY
 DEVOID
 OF ANY
 REAL
 LOGIC.
 OVER
 TIME,
 THINGS
 ROUGHLY
 SPEAKING
 GOT
 11  COMPLETELY
 OUT
 OF HAND
 AND
 I REALIZED
 THAT
 WORKING
 AS A CASTRATOR
 WAS
 MY ONLY
 SEEMING
 OUTLET
 TO DEAL
 WITH
 MY INNER
 DEMONS.
 HOWEVER,
 THE
 MORE
 TIME
 I SPENT
 IN THE
 STRANGE
 ATMOSPHERE,
 I REALIZED
 THAT
 MY PATH
 WAS
 DOWN
 RATHER
 THAN
 UP. 
I DON'T
 WANT
 TO TALK
 ABOUT
 MY CHILDHOOD
 BECAUSE
 IT WAS
 FILLED
 WITH
 STRANGE
 EXPERIENCES
 AND
 A LACK
 OF TRUE
 FRIENDS.
 I WOULD
 SAY
 THAT
 IN MY PERSON
 FELISTER
 HAD
 FOUND
 THE
 IDEAL
 HELP
ER - SOMETHING
 THAT
 WAS
 NOT
 BAD
 FOR HIM
 AT ALL.
 ALL
 THAT
 WAS
 REQUIRED
 OF ME WAS
 TO KEEP
 QUIET
 AND
 MIND
 MY OWN
 BUSINESS.
 AND
 THAT. 
THE
 STATE
 OF MISSOURI
 IN THE
 SEVENTIES
 WAS
 A SPECIAL
 PLACE.
 THE
 BIG
 CITIES
 WERE
 KANSAS
 CITY
 AND
 SPRINGFIELD.
 EACH
 OFFERING
 GOOD
 CAREER
 OPPORTUNITIES.
 I DIDN'T
 CARE,
 THOUGH,
 BECAUSE
 I KNEW
 THAT'S
 WHAT
 I WAS
 SUPPOSED
 TO BE DOING
 - CASTRATING
 PIGS! 
LITTLE
 BY LITTLE,
 FELISTER
'S CONFIDENCE
 IN ME GREW
 AND
 HE ENTRUSTED
 ME WITH
 SOME
 AUTHORITY
 WITHIN
 THE
 FARM.
 THEN
 MY STORY
 BEGAN,
 AND
 I WITNESSED
 THINGS
 BEYOND
 MY WILDEST
 IMAGINATION.
 BUT
 MORE
 ON THAT
 LATER. 
YOU
 HAVE
 ALL
 HEARD
 OF THE
 SO-CALLED
 MIDWESTERN
 STATES
 AND
 THE
 FACT
 THAT
 THESE
 TERRITORIES
 ARE
 COVERED
 WITH
 GRASSY
 PLAINS
 THAT
 STRETCH
 ALONG
 FOR HUNDREDS
 OF MILES.
 IT WAS
 A TRULY
 MAGICAL
 PLACE
 THAT
 I WON'T
 HAVE
 TIME
 TO TELL
 YOU
 ABOUT.
 I ALSO
 REALIZE
 THAT
 MY NARRATIVE
 DIGRESSES
 A BIT. 
HOW
 MANY
 TIMES
 HAD
 I NOT
 COME
 TO MY SENSES
 AND
 TRIED
 TO THROW
 IT ALL
 AWAY. 
THE
 BRUTAL
 ABUSE
 OF ANIMALS
 PUT
 ME IN ANOTHER
 UNIVERSE
 - THAT
 OF THE
 LONELY
 AND
 CONFUSED
 SOCIOPATH
 WHO
 WAS
 UNABLE
 TO THRIVE
 IN A NORMAL
 HUMAN
 ENVIRONMENT. 
12  FELISTER
 OBVIOUSLY
 DIDN'T
 CARE
 MUCH
 AND
 HADN'T
 SET
 MANY
 RULES
 FOR ME TO STAY
 ON THE
 FARM
 AND GET
 A BOWL
 OF HOT
 SOUP
 AND
 A PIECE
 OF BREAD.
 IT WAS
 ONLY
 WELCOME
 AND
 I TOOK ADVANTAGE
 OF HIS KINDNESS
 WISELY. 
OVER
 TIME,
 PERCEPTIONS
 OF THE
 SURROUNDING
 REALITY
 BECOME
 A BIT
 TEDIOUS,
 ESPECIALLY
 WHEN
 YOU
 REALIZE
 WHAT
 WAS
 ACTUALLY
 GOING
 ON - THERE
 WERE
 SO FEW
 PEOPLE
 WHO
 REALLY
 LOOKED
 DEEPLY
 INTO
 ITS
 AMBIGUOUS
 AND
 DECEPTIVE
 NATURE,
 AND
 THAT
 WAS
 SORELY
 NEEDED. 
FELISTER
 WAS
 ALSO
 A DARK
 AND
 ANTISOCIAL
 TYPE
 WHO
 GAVE
 HER
 WHOLE
 HEART
 TO FORGET
 EXTERNAL
 REALITY
 AND
 TRY
 TO FIND
 A SOLUTION
 FOR
 HER
 CONFUSED
 AND
 STRANGE
 LIFE.
 BUT
 HERE
 HE SEEMED
 TO BE COMPLETELY
 IN HIS
 PLACE
 AND
 HAD
 NO DESIRE
 TO CHANGE
 AT ALL! 
THESE
 PIGS
 WERE
 A LUCRATIVE
 BUSINESS
 FOR SOMEONE
 OF HIS
 LINEAGE
 AND
 ABILITY,
 SO HE HAD
 NO INTENTION
 OF ABANDONING
 IT AND
 LOOKING
 ELSEWHERE
 FOR
 A LIVING. 
THE
 CASTRATION
 OF THE
 PIG
 WAS
 A LABORIOUS
 OPERATION
 THAT
 SOUGHT
 TO PREVENT
 THE
 UNPLEASANT
 ODOR
 OF THE
 MEAT.
 WHAT'S
 MORE,
 CASTRATED
 PIGS
 NEEDED
 LESS
 FEED,
 WHICH
 WAS
 A REAL
 BONUS
 FOR FARMERS
 WHO
 WERE
 GENERALLY
 LOOKING
 TO CUT
 THEIR
 COSTS
 - ESPECIALLY
 ON THE
 CRUEL
 ECONOMIC
 CRISIS. 
FELISTER
 WAS
 NO MODERNIST,
 SO HE USED
 WHAT
 HE CALLED
 A FIXATOR
 CRATE
 TO HANDLE
 THE ANIMALS
 AND
 MAKE
 THE
 HANDLING
 COMPLETELY
 SEAMLESS. 
THE
 VOLUNTEERS
 WHO
 WORKED
 FOR
 FELISTER
 WERE
 MADE
 OF STAKE
 AND
 ROPE,
 BUT
 THE
 MOST
 IMPORTANT
 THING
 WAS
 THAT
 THEY
 COULD
 REALLY
 HOLD
 THEIR
 TONGUES.
 AS HARD
 AS IT WAS
 TO ACCEPT,
 THIS
 PLACE
 13  EXISTED
 BY ITS
 OWN
 LAWS
 THAT
 HAD
 TO BE ACCOUNTED
 FOR. 
AN ANCIENT
 LATIN
 MAXIM
 WAS
 "IN
 THE
 WINE
 IS THE
 TRUTH!"
 BUT
 FELISTER
 NEVER
 LICKED
 A DROP,
 AND
 THAT
 WAS
 QUITE
 TELLING. 
WHEN
 SOMEONE
 ASKED
 HIM
 WHAT
 HE DID
 FOR A LIVING,
 THE
 ANSWER
 ON HIS
 PART
 WAS
 RATHER
 EVASIVE,
 AND
 HE DIDN'T
 KNOW
 EXACTLY
 WHAT
 TO SAY,
 FOR
 PIGS
 WERE
 A COMMODITY
 OF SOMEWHAT
 OBSCURE
 ORIGIN. 
THE
 TRUTH
 WAS,
 UNDER
 COVER
 OF NIGHT,
 THE
 CASTRATED
 HOGS
 WERE
 BEING
 STUFFED
 WITH
 ENOUGH
 DRUGS
 TO GET
 ACROSS
 THE
 MEXICAN
 BORDER,
 AND
 FELISTER
'S FARM
 WAS
 JUST
 ONE
 OF MANY
 DISTRIBUTION
 POINTS.
 NO ONE
 WAS
 GOING
 TO TEST
 LIVE
 ANIMALS
 FOR SUCH
 SUBSTANCES
 OR EVEN RAISE
 THE
 ISSUE
 WITH
 STATE
 AUTHORITIES,
 BUT
 FELISTER
'S CONSCIENCE
 WAS
 SUCH
 A STRETCH.
 HE WASN'T
 DOING
 THIS
 FOR
 THE
 MONEY,
 BUT
 FOR
 THE
 SIMPLE
 FACT
 THAT
 THIS
 WAS
 THE
 ONLY
 PLACE
 HE COULD
 EXIST
 AND
 BE HIMSELF. 
WHEN
 HE CONTACTED
 THE
 MOST
 POWERFUL
 DRUG CARTELS,
 THEY
 REALIZED
 THEY
 COULD
 TRUST
 HIM,
 AND
 HE PURCHASED
 NUMEROUS
 FARMS
 THROUGHOUT
 THE
 MIDDLE
 STATES
 WHERE
 DRUGS
 WERE
 SEPARATED
 FROM
 THE
 BLOOD
 OF ANIMALS
 IN SPECIAL
 LABORATORIES.
 WHAT
 WAS
 MORE
 INTERESTING,
 THOUGH,
 WAS
 THAT
 SOMEWHERE
 IN THERE,
 FELISTER
'S INNER
 MOTIVATION
 WAS
 CLEARLY
 VISIBLE.
 THIS
 WAS
 OF COURSE
 A CUMBERSOME
 AND
 EXPENSIVE
 PROCESS.
 BUT HE WAS
 WILLING
 TO TAKE
 THE
 MOST
 ACTIVE
 PART
 AND
 TO POINT
 OUT
 TO HIS
 CUSTOMERS
 THAT
 HE
 WAS
 THEIR
 TRUE
 SUPPLIER. 
FELISTER
'S DREAM
 WAS
 DRIVEN
 BY SOMETHING
 ELSE
 ENTIRELY.
 HE WAS
 ALL
 ALONE
 IN THIS
 WORLD,
 AND
 HE WAS
 CLEARLY
 AWARE
 THAT
 HE HAD
 NO ONE
 TO SUFFER
 14  FOR,
 OR,
 TO PUT
 IT BLUNTLY,
 TO MISS.
 THE
 FRIENDSHIPS
 HE HAD
 MADE
 WERE
 IN THE
 PAST-COMPLETELY
 UNNECESSARY
 AND
 DISOWNED. 
EVEN ONCE
 THE
 FELISTER
 HIMSELF
 REMEMBERED
 SOMETHING
 STRANGE.
 OF HIS
 YOUTH,
 WHICH
 HAD BEEN
 FULL
 OF A KIND
 OF ROMANCE. 
A VERSE
 ABOUT
 FRIENDSHIP
 SPRANG
 INTO
 HIS
 MIND,
 WHICH
 READ
 AS FOLLOWS: 
''FRIENDS
 GOOD 
LIKE
 BRIGHT
 STARS, 
THE
RE ALL
 IS SEEN, 
BUT ALAS
 THAT
 IS THE
 END!
'' FELISTER
 WANTED
 TO BE GOOD,
 BUT
 HE WAS
 NOT
 LIKE
 THE
 OTHERS-HIS
 GRIEF
 WAS
 SO INTENSE
 THAT
 HE HAD
 NO EQUAL.
 NO MATTER
 HOW
 MUCH
 THEY
 SWORE
 ALLEGIANCE,
 HIS
 MEN
 WERE
 JUST
 MERCENARIES
 WHO
 WOULD
 MOST
 LIKELY
 GO TO THE
 FIRST
 PERSON
 WHO
 OFFERED
 THEM
 MORE
 AND
 MORE
 FAVORABLE
 TERMS.
 AND
 THAT
 WAS
 ACCEPTABLE
 - EVEN IN FELISTER
'S EYES. AFTER
 ALL,
 THE
 WORLD
 WAS
 ONE
 HELL
 OF A WHEEL,
 AND
 SOME
 FELL
 OFF
 IT SOONER
 AND
 OTHERS
 LATER. 

WHEN
 I, ELIZANDER
 BARNAYNE,
 SAW
 CLEARLY
 THE
 PROSPECTS
 BEFORE
 ME,
 IT BECAME
 CLEAR
 THAT
 FELISTER
 HAD
 HAD A PROFOUND
 PLAN
 FROM
 THE
 BEGINNING
 AND
 HAD
 FOLLOWED
 IT STEADFASTLY.
 BUT
 THE
 MAJORITY
 OF PEOPLE
 DIDN'T
 ACCEPT
 IT AND
 DIDN'T
 REALIZE
 HOW
 WRONG
 THEY
 WERE. 
FELISTER
 DIDN'T
 BELIEVE
 IN SALVATION
 IN THE
 AFTERLIFE,
 OR IN ANY
 SIMPLE
 STUFF
 ABOUT
 VAMPIRES
 OR WEREWOLVES.
 HE KNEW
 THAT
 THE
 ESSENTIAL
 PROPERTY
 OF LIFE
 WAS
 ITS
 INEVITABLE
 AND
 ETERNAL
 15  CHANGE,
 FULL
 OF AN INFINITE
 RANGE
 OF POSSIBILITIES,
 WHICH,
 HOWEVER,
 DID
 NOT
 SEEM SO LIMITLESS
 UPON
 CLOSER
 INSPECTION. 
THE
 WAVES
 OF LIFE
 HAD
 TAKEN
 HIM
 OVER
 AND
 BATTERED
 HIM
 MERCILESSLY,
 AND
 HE HAD
 GROWN
 DESPERATE
 FROM
 SO MANY
 SETBACKS.
 IT WAS
 HARD
 AND
 NOT
 SO REALISTIC
 TO THINK
 THAT
 FELISTER
 WOULD
 HAVE
 A HAPPY
 ENDING. 
THE
 MEXICAN
 CARTELS
 WANTED
 THE
 GOODS
 TO BE TRANSPORTED
 BY MEANS
 OF FELISTER
'S PROPERLY
 CASTRATED
 PIGS,
 AND
 THIS
 WAS
 DONE
 ON THE
 BASIS
 OF BARTER
 DEALS
 BETWEEN
 DUMMY
 COMPANIES
 AND
 THEN
 SO-CALLED
 RE-EXPORTS. 
FELISTER
 WAS
 A CRANKY
 AND
 SICK
 BASTARD
 WHO
 UNDERSTOOD
 ENOUGH
 ABOUT
 BUSINESS
 AND
 FINANCE
 TO DO THE
 MATH
 ON THE
 DRUG
 CARTELS'
 MAJOR
 POSITIONS. 

THE
 U.S.
 DRUG ENFORCEMENT
 AGENCY
 WAS
 BREATHING
 DOWN
 HIS
 NECK,
 BUT
 UNLIKE
 MANY
 OTHERS,
 HE INTENDED
 TO GET
 OUT
 OF THIS
 BUSINESS
 COMPLETELY
 CLEAN,
 SIMPLY
 BECAUSE
 HE STOOD
 FOR
 THE
 LIVING
 - NO ONE
 HAD
 EVER CONSIDERED
 HIM
 HUMAN,
 OR EVEN HIS
 EQUAL.
 THE
 AMERICAN
 AGENCY
 WAS
 A SUPER-STRUCTURE
 THAT
 HAD
 TENTACLES
 EVERYWHERE
 AND
 EMPLOYED
 THOUSANDS
 AND
 THOUSANDS
 OF PEOPLE
 AND
 WAS
 ONE
 OF THE
 BEST
 INSURED
 AND
 PROVIDED
 FOR IN EVERY
 RESPECT. 
FELISTER
 HAD
 ONE
 THOUGHT
 - WHEN
 HE STOPPED
 WITH
 THIS
 BUSINESS,
 TO LIVE
 AND
 SEE THE
 WORLD.
 CASTRATING
 PIGS
 HAD
 TAKEN
 AWAY
 ALL
 CONTACT
 WITH
 THE
 OUTSIDE
 WORLD.
 THE
 INITIATION
 OF THE
 SOUL
 WAS
 OF THE
 UTMOST
 IMPORTANCE,
 AND SO FELISTER
 PRACTICED
 ESOTERIC
 ARTS
 THAT
 COULD
 OPEN
 THE
 DOORS
 OF THE
 UNSEEN
 WORLD
 TO HIM,
 BUT
 16  WAS
 THIS
 THE
 RIGHT
 WAY
 FOR HIM
 TO PENETRATE
 THIS
 FORBIDD
EN PLACE?
  FELISTER
 WAS
 CONSULTED
 BY A VARIETY
 OF SUPERNATURAL
 CREATURES
 , WHO
 HELPED
 HIM
 SOLVE
 HIS
 OWN
 PROBLEMS,
 AND
 HE WAS
 THEIR
 LINK
 TO THIS
 WORLD!
 HE COULD
 TRAVEL
 BETWEEN
 WORLDS
 TOO! OF COURSE
 IT WAS
 A RATHER
 EXHAUSTING
 OCCUPATION,
 AND
 FOR THAT
 VERY
 REASON,
 AND
 THE
 FACT
 THAT
 HE WAS
 DEALING
 WITH
 SOME
 OF THE
 MOST
 BRUTAL
 THUGS
 AND
 REPEAT
 OFFENDERS,
 HE WAS
 ALWAYS
 GRIM
 - WITH
 THAT
 PARTICULAR
 NOTE
 OF EXTREMELY
 CLEVERLY
 DISGUISED
 TREACHERY
 AND
 BRUTALITY
 THAT
 COULD
 BE THE
 ONLY
 DRIVING
 FORCE
 FOR
 A PLACE
 LIKE
 THI
S. AND
 FRANKLY
 EVERYTHING
 WAS
 GOING
 GREAT
 FOR A WHILE
 AT LEAST! 
ONCE
 THE
 GREEDY
 AND
 BRUTAL
 FELISTER
 ASKED
 ME: - ELIZANDER,
 YOU'VE
 BEEN
 WORKING
 THE
 LONGEST
 OF ANYONE
 HERE.
 WHAT
 REALLY
 MOTIVATES
 YOU
 TO GO ON AND
 ACHIEVE
 YOUR
 DREAM?
 I NOTICE
 YOU
 ARE
 TOO
 LOYAL
 AND
 CONSCIENTIOUS,
 BUT
 THIS
 JOB
 STINKS,
 DAMN
 IT!
 EVEN
 THE
 LOWLIEST
 BASTARDS
 FROM
 TEXAS
 DON'T
 WANT
 TO DO IT AND
 SOMETIMES
 I HAVE
 A REAL
 PROBLEM
 FINDING
 PEOPLE.
 SOON
 THE
 RULES
 OF THE
 GAME
 WILL
 CHANGE
 AND
 THEN
 WE WILL
 BE OUT
 OF A JOB
 AND
 HONESTLY
 I DON'T
 WANT
 TO LECTURE
 YOU
 BUT IF YOU
 LOOK
 AROUND
 OUR
 STATE
 IS NOT
 THE
 MOST
 PROMISING.
 WHERE
 ARE
 YOU
 GOING? 
HIS
 QUESTION
 WAS
 NOT
 AT ALL
 UNREASONABLE.
 MOST
 OF THE
 PEOPLE
 ON FELISTER
 HAD
 NO EDUCATION
 AND
 WISHED
 TO STAY
 HERE
 AS LONG
 AS POSSIBLE
 - HIDDEN
 FROM
 SOCIETY
 AND ITS
 PREJUDICES.
 ONE
 PARTICULARLY
 FRACTIOUS
 EXAMPLE
 WAS
 AN EX-CONVICT
 FROM
 A FEDERAL
 PRISON
 IN CALIFORNIA
 WHO
 PREFERRED
 HIDING
 HERE,
 ILLEGALLY
 EMPLOYED,
 TO SERVING
 HIS
 LIFE
 SENTENCE. 
17  - FEW
 CAN
 DO THIS
 JOB
 LIKE
 YOU,
 ELIZANDER
 - FELISTER
 WAS
 CLEARLY
 TRYING
 TO POUR
 HIS
 SOUL
 OUT,
 BUT
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND
 LET'S
 BE REALISTIC.
 - THE
 MORE
 WE TRY
 TO ESCAPE
 OURSELVES,
 THE
 MORE
 WE GET
 STUCK
 IN OUR
 OWN
 SHIT.
 HELL
 IS AN EMOTIONAL
 STATE
 OF THE
 SOUL
 AND
 YOU
 KNOW
 IT NO WORSE
 THAN
 I DO!
 AND
 THE
 BATTLE
 BETWEEN
 THE
 MAJOR
 DRUG CARTELS
 IS GETTING
 FIERCER
 AND
 SOON
 WE WILL
 BE THE
 TARGET.
 FOR NOW
 WE ARE
 LEFT
 TO EXIST
 PEACEFULLY
 AND
 WITHOUT
 MUCH
 PREJUDICE,
 BUT WHO
 KNOWS? 
- LOOK,
 FELISTER,
 I KNOW
 YOU'RE
 TRYING
 TO KEEP
 YOUR
 SOUL
 PURE,
 AND
 IT ALL
 COMES
 AT A PRICE.
 WE MAKE
 A LOT OF MONEY,
 BUT
 NOT
 SO MUCH
 THAT
 WE FORGET
 WHAT
 WE'RE
 DOING.
 AND
 WHAT
 WE'RE
 DOING
 IS EXTREMELY
 WRONG
 AND
 DANGEROUS!
 AND
 SOON
 THE
 AUTHORITIES
 AND
 GONNA
 START
 SNIFFING
 AT ALMOST
 ALL
 THE
 FARMS
 WE USE
 FOR COVER,
 BUT
 I'LL
 STILL
 STICK
 WITH
 YOU
 TO THE
 END,
 BUDDY!
 AFTER
 ALL,
 EVERYONE
 HAS
 TO PAY
 THEIR
 DEBTS
 IN LIFE,
 RIGHT? 
IF THERE
 WAS
 ANYONE
 WHO
 WOULD
 HAVE
 LOOKED
 OUT
 FOR ME ALL
 THIS
 TIME,
 IT WAS
 THE
 CRAZY
 BREEDER. 
- "WHY?,"
 THE
 FELISTER
 LOOKED
 AT ME IN AMAZEMENT,
 'ISN'T
 THE
 FACT
 THAT
 YOU
 COULD
 TAKE
 A BULLET
 IN THE
 HEAD
 REPEATEDLY
 FROM
 THE
 REST
 OF YOUR
 COLLEAGUES
 ENOUGH
 FOR
 YOU?
 AND
 ARE
 YOU
 AT ALL
 AWARE
 THAT
 EVEN PRISONERS
 WITH
 THREE
 LIFE
 SENTENCES
 WORK
 FOR
 US NOW
 - THEY
 ALL
 KNOW
 THAT
 EVERY
 DAY
 COULD
 BE THEIR
 LAST,
 BUT
 THEY
 DO IT FOR
 THE
 SPORT.
 THAT
 IS THEIR
 DESTINY. 
FELISTER
 TOOK OUT
 A CIGARETTE
 AND
 LIT
 IT.
 IT WAS
 A SULTRY
 MAY
 EVENING.
 THERE
 WERE
 SO MANY
 STRANGE
 NOISES
 OUTSIDE,
 COMING
 FROM
 THE
 GRASS,
 WHICH
 MIGHT
 EVEN HAVE
 BEEN
 HIDDEN
 AGENTS,
 OR SOME
 WILD
 ANIMAL,
 FOR IT WAS
 NOT
 UNCOMMON
 FOR
 SUCH
 TO HANG
 ABOUT
 THE
 FARM.
 BUT
 FELISTER
 DIDN'T
 18  SEEM TO CARE
 AT ALL.
 ON THE
 CONTRARY,
 HE TOLD
 ME UNEQUIVOCALLY: 

- WHEN
 YOU
 SHOW
 YOUR
 TRUE
 FACE
 AND
 PEOPLE
 SEE
 IT,
 YOU
 SHOULD
 RUN AWAY
 AND NOT
 EXPECT
 THANKS!
 REMEMBER
 ONE
 THING
 - WE ARE
 ONLY
 TEMPORARY
 VISITORS
 AND
 NOTHING
 MORE!
 SO IF IT GETS
 HAIRY
 YOU'LL
 HAVE
 TO SAVE
 YOUR
 OWN
 ASS!
 AND
 FORGET
 THAT
 SHIT
 ABOUT
 LOYALTY
 YOU
 TOLD
 ME LAST
 NIGHT! 
I BIT
 MY LIP - HE WAS
 RIGHT. 
AFTER
 ONLY
 A FEW
 MONTHS
 WE REALLY
 CAME
 UNDER
 SIEGE
 AND
 BRUTAL
 ATTACK
 BY DETECTIVE
 JAKE
 DONOVAN'S
 MEN WHO
 WERE
 DETERMINED
 TO WIPE US OUT.
 IT WASN'T
 EASY
 OR ELEMENTARY
 TO DEAL
 WITH
 HIS
 TRAINED
 COPS
 AND
 BRUTAL
 THUGS.
 MANY
 OF MY FRIENDS
 WERE
 KILLED,
 AND
 I RAN
 AWAY
 TO SAVE
 MY HUMBLE
 HIDE
 AND
 NOT
 FALL
 SHOT
 LIKE
 A DOG.
 HOW
 ONLY
 DID
 THOSE
 TRAINED
 CREEPS
 SHOOT!
 THEIR
 BULLETS
 MADE
 THE
 FARM
 OF A FELISTER
 A SIEVE. 
FELISTER
 FELL
 SOMEWHERE
 WHEN
 THE
 FARM
 WAS
 STORMED
 WITH
 GRENADE
 LAUNCHERS
 BY THE
 POLICE
 FORCE,
 WHO
 HAD
 GIVEN
 THEIR
 WORD
 TO WIPE
 OUT
 THESE
 MALIGNANT
 ENTITIES,
 AS THEY
 CALLED
 US,
 ONCE
 AND
 FOR ALL. 
WELL,
 I CAN'T
 DENY
 THAT
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 MANAGED
 TO DEAL
 WITH
 US IN IMPRESSIVE
 FASHION. 
THE
 MISSOURI
 POLICE
 GAVE
 HIM
 IMPRESSIVE
 DECORATIONS
 TO HIS
 NAME
 AND
 GOT
 HIM
 A HUGE
 AND
 LUCRATIVE
 PROMOTION.
 EVEN MR.
 DONOVAN
 HAD
 A MEETING
 WITH
 THE
 GOVERNOR
 OF THE
 STATE
 WHERE
 HE WAS
 HINTED
 AT A FRUITFUL
 POLITICAL
 CAREER
 UNDER
 CERTAIN
 CONDITIONS
 AND
 ONLY
 IF HE LISTENED
 TO THE
 POWERFUL
 OF THE
 DAY. 
19  DONOVAN
 WAS
 NO FOOL
 AND
 GAVE
 SWEETLY
 AND
 DEARLY
 TO BE NOTICED
 AND
 THAT
 IS WHY
 HE DEFINITELY
 SUCCEEDED. 
THE
 ONLY
 POSITIVE
 THING
 WAS
 THAT
 THE
 HEADHUNTERS
 HAD
 SET HIM
 A LITTLE
 CHALLENGE,
 NAMELY
 IN GETTING
 OFF
 THE
 FARM
 A LANDMINE
 HAD BLOWN
 OFF
 BOTH
 HIS
 LEGS
 AND
 HE HAD
 TO HAVE
 PROSTHESES
 FITTED.
 EVEN FROM
 THE
 GRAVE
 FELISTER
 COULD
 REPAY
 HIS
 ENEMIES
 PROPERLY. 
I MAY
 HAVE
 NEGLECTED
 TO MENTION
 THAT,
 ALONG
 WITH
 CASTRATING
 PIGS
 AND
 WORKING
 FOR
 THE
 MEXICAN
 DRUG CARTEL,
 FELISTER
 DABBLED
 IN MAGIC
 AND
 THE
 OCCULT,
 AND
 ALSO
 IN PURE
 WITCHCRAFT
 - HE WAS
 A CROTCHETY
 AND
 BRUTAL
 BASTARD,
 AS IF HE HAD
 STEPPED
 OUT
 OF HELL.
 THAT'S
 WHY
 WE LIKED
 EACH
 OTHER
 IN OUR
 LIFETIMES. 
HE COULD
 SUMMON
 THROUGH
 DIVINATION
 ALL
 SORTS
 OF MONSTERS
 AND
 SPIRITS
 WHO
 GAVE
 HIM
 SUPERNATURAL
 PROTECTION,
 OR SO HE THOUGHT
 BEFORE
 HE WAS
 SENT
 TO THE
 OTHER
 WORLD. 
 
CHAPTER
 TWO:
 SALVATION 
 
AFTER
 THE
 DETECTIVE'S
 OPERATION,
 THE
 SURVIVORS
 WERE
 SENT
 TO A CORRECTIONAL
 "SESSION"
 IN SOME
 OF THE
 PRISONS
 IN THE
 STATES
 OF COLORADO
 AND
 CALIFORNIA.
 THE
 ONE
 WITH
 THE
 THREE
 LIFE
 SENTENCES
 WAS
 OUT
 OF LUCK,
 FOR
 HE FELL
 DEAD
 IN THE
 VERY
 POLICE
 RAID
 ON THE
 FARM. 
BY SOME
 MIRACLE
 I SURVIVED
 AND
 MANAGED
 TO GET
 THROUGH
 THE
 SWAMPS
 BEHIND
 THE
 FELISTER
 HOUS
E. THEY
 ORGANIZED
 A RAID
 TO LOOK
 FOR
 ME, BUT I CROSSED
 THE
 RIVER
 THAT
 RAN
 NEARBY
 AND
 THANKED
 20  MY HEART
 FOR THE
 FORESIGHT
 OF MY NOW
 DEAD
 EMPLOYER. 

TOO
 LONG
 HAD
 THE
 UNFORTUNATE
 EVENTS
 DRAGGED
 ON,
 LEADING
 THE
 WHOLE
 STORY
 TO THIS
 SCENARIO.
 I DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO COMPLAIN
 BECAUSE
 I WAS
 STILL
 ALIVE
 AND
 WITH
 ALL
 FOUR
 LIMBS
 UNLIKE
 MY OTHER
 COLLEAGUES. 

THE
 NIGHT
 I SPENT
 IN THE
 SWAMPS
 WAS
 TERRIBLE
 AND
 I HAD
 TO SHOW
 GREAT
 INGENUITY
 TO MANAGE
 TO KEEP
 MY STRENGTH
 AND
 RECOVER
 FOR THE
 NEW
 LIFE
 THAT
 AWAITED
 ME IN THE
 FUTURE. 
FRANKLY
 THE
 OPTIONS
 BEFORE
 ME WERE
 NOT
 TOO
 MANY,
 NOR
 PARTICULARLY
 PLEASANT,
 AND
 I HAD
 TO TAKE
 EVERYTHING
 INTO
 CONSIDERATION
 IF I WANTED
 TO SURVIVE. 
I HAVE
 HEARD
 THAT
 THOSE
 CAPTURED
 AND
 SENT
 TO STRICT
 PRISON
 CONDITIONS
 WERE
 BRUTALLY
 FORCED
 TO "WELCOME".
 ONE
 EVEN
 HAD
 HIS
 HEAD
 SMASHED
 IN WITH
 ONE
 OF THE
 CHAIR
 SEATS. 
I HAD
 AVOIDED
 ALL
 OF THESE
 THINGS,
 BUT
 THE
 MUCH
 MORE
 DIFFICULT
 AND
 NOT
 VERY
 CLEAR
 SOLUTION
 TO THE
 PROBLEM
 OF HOW
 TO SLIP
 AWAY
 AND ILLEGALLY
 CROSS
 THE
 MEXICAN
 BORDER
 WAS
 AHEAD.
 MAYBE
 THERE
 I WOULD
 GET SOME
 HELP
 FROM
 THE
 LOCALS,
 OR MAYBE
 NOT.
 I WAS
 SPANISH
 BY MOTHER,
 BUT
 BECAUSE
 OF POLITICS
 IN THE
 STATES
 I HAD
 ADOPTED
 AN ANGLO
 SAXON
 NAME,
 WHICH
 SEEMED FAR
 MORE
 PRAGMATIC. 
YET
 WHEN
 THEY
 REGISTERED
 ME AFTER
 BIRTH
 ACCORDING
 TO MY PARENTS'
 STORY
 THEY
 CHOSE
 THAT
 NAME
 FOR ME AND
 OVERALL
 I THANK
 THEM
 FOR THAT! 
FOR ALL
 THOSE
 FAMILIAR
 WITH
 THE
 HIGHWAY
 NETWORK
 IN THE
 U.S.
 I CAN
 TELL
 YOU
 THAT
 THE
 MAIN
 THOROUGHFARES
 ARE
 OVER
 A HUNDRED
 IN NUMBER
 AND
 GO BY THE
 NAME
 OF FEDERAL
 HIGHWAYS,
 BUT
 I 21  HAD
 TO TAKE
 THE
 PANAMERIC
AN HIGHWAY
 WHICH
 STARTED
 FROM
 THE
 NORTHERNMOST
 PARTS
 OF CANADA
 AND
 REACHED
 THE
 SOUTHERNMOST
 PARTS
 OF SOUTH
 AMERICA. 
IF I STUCK
 TO THAT
 ROUTE,
 HOWEVER,
 I INVARIABLY
 HAD
 TO GO THROUGH
 SAN
 ANTONIO.
 THIS
 HIGHWAY
 WAS
 THE
 LARGEST
 IN THE
 WORLD
 AND
 WAS
 OVER
 48 000
 KILOMETRES
 LONG. 
THE
 REASON
 I WENT
 TO SAN
 ANTONIO
 IN THE
 STATE
 OF TEXAS
 RATHER
 THAN,
 FOR
 EXAMPLE,
 PHOENIX
 IN THE
 STATE
 OF ARIZONA
 WAS
 THAT
 THE
 HISTORY
 OF VICE
 WAS
 AN IMPORTANT
 PART
 OF THE
 PAST
 AND
 THE
 LOCALS
 KNEW
 WELL
 THAT
 LAW
 ENFORCEMENT
 ORGANIZATIONS
 HAD FOCUSED
 MORE
 ON ACTIVITIES
 SUCH
 AS PROSTITUTION,
 GAMBLING,
 DRUGS
 AND
 PORNOGRAPHY
 RATHER
 THAN
 JUST
 DRUGS.
 IT WAS
 TRUE
 THAT
 THE
 VALLEY
 OF THE
 SUN,
 WHICH
 ENCOMPASSED
 THE
 SEVEN MILLION
 METROPOLIS
 ITSELF
 AND
 ALSO
 SCOTTSDALE,
 MESA,
 AND
 TEMPE,
 WAS
 CHARACTERIZED
 BY AREAS
 OF PARTICULARLY
 LOW CRIME,
 BUT
 I'D
 ATTRACTED
 TOO
 MUCH
 ATTENTION
 THERE.
 SO I DECIDED
 TO AVOID
 THOSE
 COMMUNITIES.
 AND
 YET CRIME
 IN PHOENIX
 WAS
 BOOMING
 DESPITE
 OFFICIAL
 STATISTICS
 THAT
 THERE
 HAD
 BEEN
 A DECLINE
 SINCE
 THE
 NINETIES.
 BUT
 THAT'S
 WHAT
 TABLOIDS
 WERE
 FOR - TO SPOUT
 HEADLINES
 AND
 TO BELIEVE
 THE
 TRIPE
 THAT
 FILLED
 THEIR
 PAGES,
 AND
 WITH
 THE
 ELECTRONIC
 MEDIA
 THINGS
 WERE
 DOWNRIGHT
 SHOCKING.
 THE
 SECOND
 AND
 NO LESS
 IMPORTANT
 REASON
 FOR HEADING
 TO THIS
 PARTICULAR
 DESTINATION
 WAS
 THE
 FACT
 THAT
 ONE
 OF THE
 UNOFFICIAL
 ROUTES
 THAT
 WERE
 PART
 OF THIS
 SAME
 HIGHWAY
 PASSED
 THROUGH
 SAN
 ANTONIO.
 OF COURSE,
 I SHOULDN'T
 HAVE
 FAILED
 TO MENTION
 THAT
 THE
 ORIGINAL
 HIGHWAY
 STARTED
 JUST
 ACROSS
 THE
 BORDER
 FROM
 SAN
 ANTONIO,
 AND
 THIS
 WAS
 RELEVANT
 TO MY ESCAPE
 ATTEMPT. 
22  FIRST
 I HAD
 TO MAKE
 MY WAY
 TO THE
 MISSOURI
 STATE
 LINE,
 WHERE
 I COULD
 DEFINITELY
 GET
 IN TROUBLE
 WITH
 THE
 FEDERAL
 AUTHORITIES
 DUE TO MY LACK
 OF PAPERS,
 AND MY SCRUFFY
 APPEARANCE.
 I HAD
 AT LEAST
 MADE
 AN EFFORT
 TO WASH
 OFF THE
 BLOOD
 AS MUCH
 AS POSSIBLE
 AND
 THUS
 DEAL
 WITH
 ANY
 SUSPICIONS
 THAT
 MIGHT
 ARISE
 FROM
 SOME
 UNEXPECTED
 CHECK
 BY A HIDDEN
 ROADSIDE
 POLICE
 POST. 

IT WASN'T
 PARTICULARLY
 EASY
 RELIVING
 THE
 NIGHTMARES
 THAT
 FLOODED
 MY MIND.
 THERE
 WAS
 DEFINITELY
 TOO MUCH
 TO DEAL
 WITH.
 THE
 NIGHTMARES
 OF FALLING
 INTO
 A BOTTOMLESS
 DARK
 SHAFT,
 OR JUST
 SOME
 STRANGE
 AND
 MALEVOLENT
 CREATURE
 APPROACHING
 YOU
 IN THE
 DARKNESS,
 AND
 YOU
 TRYING
 TO KEEP
 IT AT BAY
 BY MEANS
 OF YOUR
 LIT BEDSIDE
 LAMP
 WERE
 NOTHING
 COMPARED
 TO THE
 ABYSS
 OF DESPAIR
 INTO
 WHICH
 I WAS
 PLUNGED.
 I HAD
 ONCE
 READ
 IN SPECIALIST
 PUBLICATIONS,
 SUCH
 AS WERE
 FOUND
 ON FELISTER
'S FARM,
 BUT
 HE KEPT
 THEM
 UNDER
 LOCK
 AND
 KEY
 IN A WELL-INSULATED
 UNDERGROUND
 CLOSET,
 WHERE
 THEY
 WERE
 LOCKED
 IN A SPECIAL
 VAULT
 BURIED
 IN THE
 GROUND.
 FROM
 TIME
 TO TIME,
 FELISTER
 WOULD
 PULL
 IT OUT
 AND
 MANA
GE TO ABSORB
 SOME
 OF THE
 NEW
 DEMONIC
 KNOWLEDGE,
 WITH
 WHICH
 HE WAS
 ABLE
 TO PSYCHOLOGICALLY
 HOLD
 THE
 OTHER
 ABNORMALS
 WHO
 WERE
 MIMICKING
 ACTIVITY
 WITHIN
 THE
 CONFINES
 OF HIS
 DOMAIN.
 IT WAS
 FROM
 THERE
 THAT
 I LEARNED
 MANY
 SUBTLE
 THINGS
 ABOUT
 THAT
 WORLD
 THAT
 I WOULD
 NOT
 EVEN
 WISH
 TO NAME
 - ONE
 OF THEM,
 HOWEVER,
 WAS
 THAT
 ONCE
 A PERSON
 IS MARKED
 IT IS MOST
 LIKELY
 FOR LIFE. 
IT WAS
 OBVIOUS
 THAT
 ON MY WAY
 TO THE
 BORDER
 I COULD
 NOT
 MOVE
 THROUGH
 OPEN
 SPACES
 AND
 HAD
 TO WALK
 THROUGH
 SOME
 DIFFICULT
 WOODED
 TERRAIN
 WHERE
 TREE
 SPECIES
 SUCH
 AS OAK,
 WALNUT
 AND
 RED
 CEDAR
 WERE
 PREVALENT.
 OF COURSE,
 SOMETIMES
 I WOULD
 STOP
 BY SOME
 OF THE
 LARGER
 TOWNS
 TO GET
 23  FOOD
 OR EVEN THE
 MOST
 BASIC
 THINGS
 LIKE
 DRINKING
 WATER.
 YOU
 ASK
 WHERE
 I GOT
 THE
 MONEY!
 WELL,
 I HAD TO APPLY
 SOME
 TRICKS,
 BECAUSE
 AS THE
 EASTERN
 PEOPLES
 USED
 TO SAY
 "TO
 LOSE
 FACE"
 WAS
 ONE
 OF THE
 MOST
 SERIOUS
 CRIMES
 AND
 COULD
 REALLY
 COST
 YOU
 YOUR
 HEAD
 IN THE
 LITERAL
 SENSE. 
I DON'T
 WANT
 TO BORE
 YOU
 WITH
 THE
 NATURAL
 BEAUTY
 OF MISSOURI,
 BUT
 THERE
 IS SOMETHING
 THAT
 EVERYONE
 WHO
 RESIDES
 IN
 THIS
 STATE
 SHOULD
 KNOW.
 THE
 CRIME
 RATES
 WERE
 HUGE!
 SO THERE
 WAS
 NO REASON
 TO MISS
 GETTING
 OUT
 OF THAT
 HOLE! 
THE
 FELISTER
 HOUSE
 WAS
 CREEPY
 ENOUGH,
 BUT
 THE
 PEACE
 I FOUND
 THERE
 WAS
 SOMETHING
 IMPORTANT
 TO ME - I REALIZED
 THAT
 ONCE
 I CROSSED
 THE
 BORDER,
 I WOU
LD BE STARTING
 A WHOLE
 NEW
 LIFE
 IN MEXICO
 AND
 MOST
 LIKELY
 UNDER
 A FOREIGN
 IDENTITY.
 IT WASN'T
 EASY
 TO BREAK
 WITH
 THE
 PAST,
 BUT
 I ALSO
 HAD
 TO THINK
 ABOUT
 THE
 FUTURE. 
SOMEONE
 ELSE
 IN MY PLACE
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 JUST
 CROSSED
 THE
 OZARK
 MOUNTAINS
 OR THE
 OZARK
 PLATEAU
 - CALL
 IT WHAT
 YOU
 WILL,
 OR STAYED
 IN A TERRITORY
 THAT
 WOULD
 GUARANTEE
 HIM
 PEACE
 FOR A LONGER
 TIME,
 BUT
 IN MY CASE
 THINGS
 WERE
 A LITTLE
 DIFFERENT. 

YES, IN THE
 END,
 IT DID
 TAKE
 SPENDING
 SOME
 TIME
 IN AN OLD BARN
 BEFORE
 THINGS
 REALLY
 SETTLED
 DOWN. 
I THEN
 HEADED
 TO OKLAHOMA,
 WHERE
 I WAS
 ABLE
 TO CONNECT
 WITH
 SOME
 OTHER
 MEMBERS
 OF THE
 WELL
 ESTABLISHED
 FELISTER
 NETWORK.
 IT TURNED
 OUT
 HE WAS
 TOO
 SMART
 AND
 THE
 MONEY
 WAS
 IN OFFSHORE
 ACCOUNTS
 SCATTERED
 ALL
 OVER
 THE
 PLACE.
 HE HAD NAMED
 THIS
 MONEY
 "FELISTER
'S LEGACY".
 ALL OF THIS,
 OF COURSE,
 I FOUND
 OUT
 FROM
 ONE
 OF THE
 MORE
 SENIOR
 MEMBERS
 OF THE
 ORGANIZATION.
 THE
 IDEA
 24  WAS
 TO START
 A SIMILAR
 ACTIVITY
 LATER
 IF SOMEONE
 DUG UP THE
 PIGS. 
FELISTER
 WAS
 PRESCIENT
 AND
 I UNDERSTOOD
 THAT
 HE PRAYED
 NOT
 ONLY
 TO THE
 DEMONS
 BUT
 ALSO
 RELIED
 ON HIS
 OWN
 BRAIN. 
THE
 SENIOR
 MEMBER
 OF "FELISTER
'S FARM,"
 AS OUR
 ORGANIZATION
 WAS
 KNOWN,
 WAS
 UNWILLING
 TO GIVE
 ME ANY
 MORE
 SERIOUS
 HELP,
 BUT
 ONLY
 WARNED
 ME TO BEWARE
 BECAUSE
 OF THE
 INCREASED
 SCRUTINY
 BETWEEN
 THE
 BORDER
 BETWEEN
 THE
 TWO
 COUNTRIES. 

I DIDN
'T HAVE
 MUCH
 TIME
 TO WANDER
 AROUND
 SAN
 ANTONIO,
 BUT
 I FOUND
 THE
 PLACE
 GOOD
 AND
 QUIET
 ENOUGH
 BY MY STANDARDS. 
HOWEVER,
 THE
 MORE
 I LEARNED
 ABOUT
 THE
 HIERARCHICAL
 STRUCTURE
 OF FELISTER
'S ORGANIZATION,
 THE
 MORE
 I BEGAN
 TO REALIZE
 THAT
 THERE
 WAS
 SOMETHING
 MORE
 LURKING
 THERE
 THAT
 WAS
 PERHAPS
 BEYOND
 MY WILDEST
 DREAMS. 
BUT I STILL
 WASN'T
 READY
 TO ACCEPT
 THE
 HARD
 TRUTH! 

TO DO BETTER,
 THOUGH,
 I TOOK ADVANTAGE
 OF THE
 STASHED
 MONEY
 I HAD
 WHILE
 TOURING
 THE
 COUNTRY.
 SUCH
 ACTIONS
 WERE
 WISE
 ENOUGH
 IN HARD
 TIMES
 LIKE
 THESE!
 THE
 THING
 WAS
 THAT
 THE
 NEUTERED
 ANIMALS
 WERE
 TAKING
 A VERY
 STRANGE
 ROUTE
 AND
 WERE
 BEING
 REPLACED
 JUST
 BEFORE
 THE
 BORDER
 ITSELF,
 WHILE
 ANOTHER
 TRUCK
 OF ORDINARY
 NEUTERED
 SHOPARS
 WAS
 PASSING
 THROUGH
 A BIT
 EARLIER
 AND
 BEING
 CHECKED
 BY CUSTOMS
 OFFICIALS.
 IN THE CASE
 OF THE
 SECOND
 TRUCK,
 WHERE
 THE
 FELISTER
 GOODS
 WERE,
 OR RATHER
 THE
 MEXICAN
 CARTEL
 GOODS,
 THE
 INSPECTION
 WAS
 CONSIDERABLY
 SHORTER,
 AND
 THE
 INJECTED
 PIGS
 WERE
 PUT
 IN A SPECIAL
 CAPSULE
 WHICH
 WAS
 UNDER
 THE
 BODY
 - A 25  SORT
 OF DOUBLE
 BOTTOM.
 THE
 DESIGN
 OF THE TRUCKS
 WAS
 ALSO
 FELISTER
'S WORK,
 WHICH
 MADE
 ME THINK
 HE WAS
 TOO
 FARSIGHTED
 AND
 TECHNICALLY
 LITERATE
 ENOUGH
 TO HANDLE
 SUCH
 PROBLEMS. 
WELL,
 IT WAS
 NOT
 IMPOSSIBLE
 THAT
 THE
 GOODS
 MIGHT
 OCCASIONALLY
 GET
 CAUGHT,
 BUT
 IN GENERAL
 MR.
 EMBANKS
 WAS
 AWARE
 OF THESE
 RISKS
 AND
 COULD
 AFFORD
 TO LOSE
 EVEN THIRTY
 PER CENT
 OF THE
 FINAL
 SHIPMENT
 AS LONG
 AS THE
 OTHER
 SEVENTY
 ARRIVED
 AT THEIR
 FINAL
 DESTINATION.
 WHAT
 WAS
 THE
 POINT
 OF THE
 REVERSE
 MOVEMENT
 - VERY
 SIMPLY
 THE
 INJECTED
 SUBSTANCES
 WERE
 BLANKS
 THAT
 WERE
 USED
 TO PRODUCE
 THE
 FINAL
 SUBSTANCE,
 AND
 A HUGE
 PRODUCTION
 COULD
 VERY
 EASILY
 BE ACHIEVED
 IN A FINITE
 TIME
 FRAME,
 WHICH
 WAS
 THEN
 RE-IMPORTED
 BY OTHER
 ROUTES. 
BUT I WASN'T
 GOING
 TO FURTHER
 MY CAREER
 AS A GANGSTER,
 I WAS
 GOING
 TO FIND
 ANSWERS
 FOR MY OWN
 EXISTENCE. 
THE
 KIND
 FACES
 OF THE
 PAST
 WERE
 BUT
 PALE
 MEMORIES,
 REPLACED
 BY THE
 BRUTAL
 REALITY
 AND
 SUFFERING
 THAT
 SURROUNDED
 US.
 YES IN THE
 ORPHANAGE,
 AS HORRIBLE
 AS IT WAS,
 FOR A SHORT
 TIME
 I HAD
 SOME
 SEMBLANCE
 OF FRIENDS.
 AND
 FOR THE
 FIRST
 TIME
 I LEARNED
 TO JUDGE
 PEOPLE. 
AFTER
 I TRANSFERRED
 TO MEXICO
 AND
 GOT A FAKE
 PASSPORT
 FOR
 MY MONEY,
 I SET
 ABOUT
 CONTEMPLATING
 MY NEXT
 STEPS. 
THINGS
 DIDN'T
 LOOK
 ROSY,
 BUT
 FELISTER
 HAD
 TOLD
 ME TO RELY
 ON MYSELF
 AND
 ONLY
 MYSELF.
 I STILL
 REMEMBERED
 HIS
 ALL
 TOO
 THOUGHTFUL
 MESSAGE
 THAT
 WE WERE
 ONLY
 TEMPORARY
 VISITORS
 TO THIS
 WORLD. 

I GUESSED
 THAT
 FELISTER
 HAD
 BEEN
 THROWING
 HIS
 MONEY
 AROUND
 IN VARIOUS
 OFFSHORE
 COMPANIES
 26  THAT
 WOULD
 HAVE
 BEEN PRETTY
 HARD
 TO FIGURE
 OUT,
 BUT I WAS
 ALSO
 SURE
 OF SOMETHING
 ELSE.
 EMBANX
 HAD
 MADE
 SOME
 MISTAKE
 - NO MATTER
 HOW
 BIG
 OR SMALL
 OR HE WOULDN'T
 HAVE
 BEEN
 SHOT
 LIKE
 A DOG
 ON HIS
 OWN
 PORCH. 
BUT WHO
 WAS
 MY FORMER
 EMPLOYER,
 REALLY,
 AND
 WHAT
 DID
 I KNOW
 ABOUT
 HIM? 
ALMOST
 NOTHING
 - EXCEPT
 THAT
 HE HAD
 TAKEN
 ME UNDER
 HIS
 WING
 FROM
 AN ORPHANAGE
 IN KANSAS
 CITY
 WHERE
 I HAD
 BEEN
 DUMPED
 BY MY PARENTS,
 WHO,
 ON TOP OF THAT,
 I DIDN'T
 EVEN REMEMBER. 
FELISTER
 WAS
 LIKE
 MY FATHER
 OR STEPFATHER
 OR GUARDIAN
 OR I DON'T
 KNOW
 EXACTLY
 WHAT
 ANYMORE
 EITHER...
 BUT
 HE WAS
 LONG
 GONE! 
I KNEW
 THAT
 MEXICAN
 DRUG CARTELS
 WERE
 FAMOUS
 FOR THEIR
 CRUELTY
 AND
 UNSCRUPULOUSNESS,
 AND
 I DIDN'T
 PARTICULARLY
 CARE,
 SINCE
 I WAS
 ABOUT
 TO WALK
 RIGHT
 INTO
 THE
 LION'S
 MOUTH.
 SOMETIMES
 SERIOUS
 CONFLICTS
 WOULD
 LITERALLY
 BREAK
 OUT
 BETWEEN
 LOCAL
 GROUPS
 OR SEPARATE
 FACTIONS,
 EACH
 FIGHTING
 FOR SUPREMACY.
 THE
 MAJOR
 PLAYERS
 WERE
 FEW
 AND
 EACH
 WIELDED
 ENORMOUS
 POWER
 AND
 CONTROL. 
IN ANY
 SERIOUS
 ORGANIZATION
 WHERE
 OPIOID
 SUBSTANCES
 WERE
 PREPARED,
 THERE
 WAS
 ALWAYS
 A COOK,
 HELPERS,
 AND
 AN OVERSEER. 
BUT I DID
 NOT
 GO AS A PARLIAMENTARIAN
 OR AS A PERSON
 SEEKING
 DIRECT
 FINANCIAL
 GAIN
 AS THE
 SOLE
 SURVIVOR
 OF THE
 BRUTAL
 POGROM
 ON THE
 FARM.
 NOR
 WAS
 I GOING
 AS A REFUGEE.
 I WASN'T
 GOING
 AS A ROMANTIC.
 I WAS
 GOING
 AS A LOST
 SOUL
 YEARNING
 TO FIND
 MYSELF. 
THE
 STREETS
 OF MONTEREY,
 WHERE
 I DECIDED
 TO STOP
 FOR
 A WHILE,
 WERE
 HOT
 AS HELL.
 AND
 I DECIDED
 27  I REALLY
 NEEDED
 TO STAY
 SOMEPLACE
 FOR A WHILE
 LONGER.
 PERHAPS
 AFTER
 ALL
 THESE
 EXPLANATIONS
 MANY
 HAD
 WONDERED
 JUST
 WHAT
 ANSWERS
 I NEEDED?
 THE
 MOSQUITOES
 WERE
 ALSO
 A HUGE
 AND
 BRUTAL
 PLAGUE.
 BUT
 APPARENTLY
 YOU
 COULDN'T
 DO WITHOUT
 THEM!
 APPARENTLY
 THE
 EARTH
 WAS
 THEIR
 PARADISE! 

"IT
 WAS
 GOOD AGAIN
 THAT
 I BYPASSED
 THE
 SYUDAD
 HUARES,
 WHERE
 THE
 NUMBER
 OF MURDERS
 PER YEAR
 IS SEVERAL
 THOUSAND,"
 I THOUGHT
 TO
 MYSELF.
 "EVEN THE
 MILITARY
 GARRISONS
 DEPLOYED
 ARE
 UNABLE
 TO CURB THE
 BRUTAL
 ARBITRARINESS
 AND
 VIOLENCE.
 I'VE
 HEARD
 THAT
 SOMETIMES
 THE
 BLOOD
 IN THE
 STREETS
 IS ALMOST
 LIKE
 A RIVER!
 IF THERE
 IS A HELL,
 IT IS HERE
 ON THIS
 EARTH!" 
THE
 CITY
 WAS
 IMPRESSIVE
 FOR ITS
 ATMOSPHERE
 AND
 NOT
 LEAST
 ITS
 ARCHITECTURE,
 WHERE
 SO MANY
 STYLES
 MINGLED. 
AND
 THEN
 I SAW
 HER
 - DRESSED
 IN RED,
 WITH
 A GENTLE
 AND
 BEAUTIFUL
 FACE.
 I HEADED
 OVER
 AND
 NOTICED
 THAT
 THIS
 WOMAN'S
 IMAGE
 WAS
 PRINTED
 ON A HUGE
 BANNER,
 AND
 UNDERNEATH
 SOME
 HAND
 HAD
 SCRAWLED
 THE
 RATHER
 UNREMARKABLE
 "CALL!".
 THERE
 WAS
 SOME
 NUMBER
 SCRAWLED
 ON IT,
 AND
 AFTER
 LOOKING
 AT MY HAND,
 I REALIZED
 IT WAS
 EXACTLY
 THE
 SAME
 AS THE
 ONE
 ON THE
 BANNER. 
I DECIDED
 TO DO IT AND
 THAT
 ACTION
 OF MINE
 TURNED
 MY LIFE
 AROUND. 
 
CHAPTER
 THREE:
 NEW FRIENDS 
 
DROVE
 ME TO ONE
 OF THE
 SUBURBS
 THAT
 WERE
 FULL
 OF LIFE.
 BY THE
 WAY,
 MONTERREY
 WAS
 THE
 CAPITAL
 OF 28  THE
 NORTHEASTERN
 MEXICAN
 STATE
 OF NUEVO
 LE29  HOWL
 LIKE
 A WILD
 WOLF.
 LIKE
 A MORTALLY
 WOUNDED
 ANIMAL!
 SO THE
 EXISTENCE
 OF A MAN
 LIKE
 A FELISTER
 EVEN DEFIED
 THE
 LAWS
 OF PHYSICS. 
- "I
 KNOW
 HE WAS
 VERY
 PARTICULAR,"
 SHE
 LAUGHED
 SOURLY. 

- "BUT
 I WONDER
 WHAT
 THE
 MATHEMATICAL
 PROBABILITY
 IS OF US GETTING
 STUCK
 IN A PLACE
 LIKE
 THIS,"
 I ASKED
 HER,
 TRYING
 TO SOUND
 AS CASUAL
 AS POSSIBLE. 

I DIDN'T
 BELIEVE
 IN CHANCE.
 FELISTER
 - THAT
 SICK,
 DERANGED,
 BRUTAL
 AND
 ARROGANT
 BASTARD
 MUST
 HAVE
 HAD
 SOME
 DASTARDLY
 PLAN
 AND
 CLEARLY
 HIS
 DIABOLICAL
 GAME
 WAS
 STARTING
 TO BEAR
 SOME
 FRUIT.
 "FILTHY
 SADIST!"
 THOUGHT
 I. "PITIFUL
 SEMBLANCE
 OF A MAN!
 AN ANIMAL!
 DEVILISH
 FREAK!
 DAMNED
 SATAN!" 
- "YOUR
 CHANCE
 OF SALVATION
 IS ME,"
 LAUGHED
 HIS NIECE
 AGAIN.
 "YOU
 MAY
 NOT
 LIKE
 TO BELIEVE
 IT,
 BUT
 FELISTER
 LOVED
 YOU
 LIKE
 A SON-WELL,
 IN HIS
 OWN
 WAY.
 AND
 IF I AM DOING
 THIS
 NOW
 IT IS NOT
 OUT
 OF LOVE
 FOR YOU,
 OR BECAUSE
 YOU
 ARE
 VERY
 AGREEABLE
 TO ME,
 BUT
 BECAUSE
 I AM SIMPLY
 DOING
 MY JOB." 
- "Y-
YES," SHE PRONOUNCED,
 LINGERINGLY,
 "YOU
 MUST
 BE WONDERING
 HOW
 I FOUND
 YOU.
 WELL,
 MORE
 ACCURATELY,
 YOU
 FOUND
 ME UNKNOWINGLY,
 FOLLOWING
 YOUR
 GUARDIAN'S
 INSTRUCTIONS."
 I LOOKED
 AT HER
 GLASSY
 EYES AND
 IF I DIDN'T
 CONSIDER
 MYSELF
 A SOLID
 LITTLE
 MAN
 I PROBABLY
 WOULD
 HAVE
 SCREAMED.
 THERE
 WAS
 SOMETHING
 PARTICULARLY
 STRANGE
 ABOUT
 HER
 WHOLE
 AURA. 
- "YOU
 MEAN
 THE
 STRANGE
 AURA
 AROUND
 FELISTER
 LED
 ME HERE?,"
 I ADDRESSED
 HER
 DIRECTLY. 
30  - 'WELL,
 HIS
 DEATH
 WASN'T
 ENTIRELY
 UNEXPECTED,"
 SHE
 ANSWERED
 ME UNPERTURBED. 
I THOUGHT
 SHE
 WAS A BIT
 TOO SASSY,
 AND
 I WAS
 DEFINITELY
 A BIT
 ANNOYED.
 THE
 PLACE,
 WHICH
 MIGHT
 OTHERWISE
 HAVE
 BEEN
 FULL,
 WAS
 NOW
 STRANGELY
 QUIET
 AND
 YOU
 COULD
 TELL
 THERE
 WAS
 NO ONE
 THERE. 

- "I
 SENT
 THE
 STAFF
 AWAY,"
 SHE
 YAWNED,
 AS IF READING
 MY THOUGHTS.
 - YOU
 PROBABLY
 EXPECT
 SOME
 ANSWERS,
 BUT
 YOU'LL
 HAVE
 TO GET
 THEM
 YOURSELF.
 FELISTER
 WAS
 LIKE
 THAT.
 HE DIDN'T
 LIKE
 WEAKLINGS,
 MUCH
 LESS
 COWARDS.
 AND
 DIED
 SHROUDED
 IN MYSTERY! 
I LISTENED
 TO HER
 AS IF SPELLBOUND.
 I DID
 NOT
 KNOW
 WHAT
 TO THINK,
 NOR
 HOW
 FAR
 I COULD
 TRUST
 HER. 
HER
 LIPS
 WHISPERED
 ENCHANTING
 WORDS
 WHICH
 AT THE
 SAME
 TIME
 WERE
 NOT
 AT ALL
 DEVOID
 OF MEANING
 AND
 CONTENT. 
- "THE
 MAIN
 CARTELS
 IN MEXICO
 ARE
 SIX
 AND
 YOU
 KNOW
 THAT
 VERY
 WELL.
 BUT
 WHAT
 YOU
 DON'T
 SUSPECT
 IS THAT
 FELISTER
 WORKED
 FOR
 ALL
 OF THEM,
 AND
 NEVER
 HAD
 ANY
 SCRUPLES
 ABOUT
 IT!,"
 SHE
 STARED
 AT ME AS SHE
 SAID
 THE
 LAST. 
- "SO HE'S
 BEEN
 PLAYING
 HIS
 GAME
 ALL
 ALONG,"
 I SMILED,
 'AND
 I'VE
 GOT
 TO LEAN
 THE
 PAWN
 FOR HIM. 
- "LOOK,
 I DON'T
 KNOW
 WHAT
 WORLD
 YOU
 COME
 FROM,
 BUT THERE'S
 SOMETHING
 ELSE
 HERE,"
 SHE
 TURNED
 TO ME CRYPTICALLY,
 "DON'T
 IGNORE
 THE
 BRUTALITY
 WITH
 WHICH
 THE
 MAIN
 DRUG CARTELS
 PUT
 DOWN
 THE
 RESISTANCE
 AGAINST
 THEM.
 MANY
 DIED
 FAR
 TOO
 YOUNG.
 THE
 FACT
 THAT
 YOU
 GOT AWAY
 IS A BLESSING
 ON THE
 ONE
 HAND
 AND
 A CURSE
 ON THE
 OTHER.
 BUT YOU
 WILL
 CARRY
 IT WITH
 YOU
 TO THE
 END." 
31  I LISTENED
 TO HER
 TOO CAREFULLY
 AND
 DIDN'T
 SAY
 A WORD. 

- "I
 CAN
 TELL
 YOU
 ONE
 THING
 FOR
 SURE,"
 SHE
 DECIDED
 TO END
 HER
 CONVERSATION
 WITH
 ME,
 "ONCE
 YOU
 GET
 INTO
 THIS
 GAME,
 THERE
 IS NO GETTING
 OUT.
 MANY
 OF THE
 MEMBERS
 OF THE
 MORE
 EFFECTIVE
 CARTELS
 HAVE
 LONG
 BEEN
 TRAINED
 PARAMILITARIES
 OF THE
 MEXICAN
 ARMY,
 WHICH
 HAS
 STRONG
 CONTROL
 HERE
 IN MEXICO.
 PORTS
 LIKE
 LAZARO
 CARDENAS
 ARE
 KEY
 TO SOME
 OF THEM.
 BUT
 YOU
 DIDN'T
 ACTUALLY
 COME
 TO HEAR
 ALL
 THIS!" 

- "I
 JUST
 WANT
 TO KNOW
 WHY
 THEY
 KILLED
 MY PATRON,
 FELISTER
," I SAID. 
- "WELL,
 IT'S
 A DELICATE
 SUBJECT.
 IF YOU'RE
 WITH
 EVERYONE,
 YOU'RE
 WITH
 ABSOLUTELY
 NO ONE.
 'AND
 THAT
 MEANS
 A HUNDRED
 YEARS
 OF LONELINESS,"
 SHE
 JOKED. 

- "THANKS
 FOR QUOTING
 MARQUES,
 BUT
 IT'S
 NOT
 UP TO ME, HONEST,"
 I HUNG MY HEAD. 
- "LOOK,
 IF YOU
 WANT
 TO LIVE
 JUST
 A LITTLE
 LONGER,
 YOU'LL
 HAVE
 TO THINK
 ABOUT
 MY WORDS
 COMPLETELY
 SERIOUSLY,"
 SHE
 FINALLY
 ENDED
 HER
 CONVERSATION
 WITH
 ME. THEN
 SHE
 JUST
 TURNED
 AND
 WALKED
 OUT
 OF THE
 RESTAURANT.
 I ASSUMED
 THERE
 WERE
 ENOUGH
 GUARDS
 AROUND
 TO BREAK
 MY NECK
 IN CASE
 OF NEED. 
I WAS
 BACK
 ON THE
 STREET
 AGAIN
 WITH
 NO MONEY
 AND
 NO INFORMATION
 WHATSOEVER
 - I HAD
 REMAINED
 A LONE
 WOLF
 ALL
 THESE
 YEARS,
 WELL
 AWARE
 OF SOME
 THINGS,
 BUT
 ULTIMATELY
 AT A DEAD
 END. 
IT HAD
 STARTED
 TO DRIZZLE
 A FINE
 RAIN,
 AND
 IN OTHER
 CIRCUMSTANCES
 IT WOULD
 PROBABLY
 HAVE
 BEEN
 32  ROMANTIC,
 BUT
 IN THE
 CURRENT
 ONE
 I WASN'T
 FEELING
 PARTICULARLY
 ENTHUSIASTIC. 
AND
 THEN
 I WAS
 STUFFED
 INTO
 A TRUNK
 AND
 WE WERE
 OFF
 IN AN UNKNOWN
 DIRECTION. 
APPARENTLY
 I WAS
 REALLY
 ABOUT
 TO SEE
 HOW
 DEEP
 THE
 RABBIT
 HOLE
 WAS,
 AS THE
 LINE IN THAT
 FAMOUS
 TV MOVIE
 WENT. 
THE
 JOB
 WAS
 THAT
 THE
 MEXICAN
 GOVERNMENT
 HAD
 MADE
 IT A POINT
 TO DEAL
 WITH
 ALL
 THOSE
 WHO
 WERE
 MUDDYING
 ITS
 WATERS. 
IT WAS
 VERY
 EASY
 FOR
 THEM,
 BUT
 THE
 ANSWERS
 I WAS
 LOOKING
 FOR WERE
 STILL
 TOO
 VAGUE. 
AND
 THEN
 I REALIZED
 THAT
 THE
 WOMAN
 I HAD
 MET
 HAD
 ACTUALLY
 TOLD ME A LOT
 MORE
 THAN
 I THOUGHT
 SHE
 HAD. 

I WALKED
 THROUGH
 THE
 STREETS
 OF THE
 CITY,
 LOST
 IN UNHAPPY
 THOUGHTS,
 FULLY
 AWARE
 OF WHAT
 MIGHT
 LIE AHEAD.
 THIS
 WAS
 THE
 ROAD
 TO HELL,
 OR MAYBE
 EVEN A MUCH
 WORSE
 PLACE
 - ONLY
 IT WAS
 ONLY
 THE
 BEGINNING
 OF THE
 ROAD
 FOR NOW. 
AFTER
 ALL,
 MONTEREY
 WASN'T
 EXACTLY
 A SAFE
 PLACE,
 AND
 SOME
 PARTS
 OF IT HELD
 ENOUGH
 RISKS
 TO KEEP
 ONE
 FROM
 WALKING
 RIGHT
 THERE
 WITH
 HANDS IN POCKETS.
 ANYWAY
 I STARTED
 TO THINK
 ABOUT
 EXACTLY
 WHERE
 I WANTED
 TO GET
 TO. EVEN WITH
 THE
 MONEY
 I HAD
 COLLECTED
 FROM
 THAT
 "HELPER"
 OF FELISTER
'S AND
 MY OWN,
 I HAD
 A LITTLE
 OVER
 TWO
 THOUSAND
 DOLLARS. 
I DECIDED
 THAT
 THE
 SMART
 THING
 TO DO WAS
 TO INVEST
 IT IN A COMMODITY
 THAT
 COULD
 BE BOUGHT
 AT DISCOUNTED
 PRICES.
 BUT
 I HAD
 TO CONTACT
 SOMEON
E. 33  I MUST
 HAVE
 MADE
 A NAME
 FOR MYSELF
 AROUND
 THE
 NEIGHBORHOOD,
 BECAUSE
 IT WASN'T
 LONG
 BEFORE
 THE
 WOMAN
 IN THE
 RED
 DRESS
 SOUGHT
 ME OUT
 AGAIN,
 THIS
 TIME
 WITH
 A SERIOUS
 ENOUGH
 EXPRESSION
 ON HER
 FACE. 
- "YOU
 CAN'T
 SELL
 THAT
 STUFF
 ON OUR
 TERRITORY,"
 SHE
 REPLIED,
 "IF YOU
 KEEP
 DOING
 THAT,
 WE'LL
 JUST
 CLEAN
 YOU
 OUT
 - AND
 BADLY.
 AND
 FELISTER
 HAS
 EVIDENTLY
 NOT
 EXPLAINED
 TO YOU
 THE
 REAL
 RULES
 OF THE
 BUSINESS.
 THAT,
 I THINK,
 IS RATHER
 SAD.
 BY THE
 WAY,
 FELISTER
 LEFT
 A LEGACY,
 AS FAR
 AS I KNOW.
 IT'S
 UP TO YOU
 WHETHER
 YOU
 WANT
 TO ACCEPT
 IT,
 AND
 YOUR
 DECISION
 WILL
 PROLONG
 YOUR
 LIFE,
 PERHAPS." 
- "I'D
 LIKE
 TO KNOW
 WHAT
 THAT
 WHOLE
 DEMON
 THING
 WAS
 ALL
 ABOUT?,"
 I ASKED.
 "AFTER
 ALL,
 FELISTER
 WORSHIPPED
 SOME
 DEMON
 CULT
 OR SOMETHING." 
- WELL,
 ALL
 IN ALL,
 THAT'S
 TOO WEIRD.
 HE BELIEVED
 HE WOULD
 BE KILLED
 SOONER
 OR LATER.
 AND IT HAPPENED. 

- "WELL,
 IF I ACCEPT
 THE
 FELISTER
'S LEGACY,
 SO WHAT?,"
 I WONDERED. 
THEN
 SHE
 STOOD
 UP AGAIN
 AND
 MADE
 A SIGN
 WITH
 HER
 HAND
 FOR ME TO FOLLOW
 HER. 
 
CHAPTER
 FOUR:
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN 
 
DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 WAS
 FEELING
 GREAT
 AFTER
 HIS
 PROMOTION.
 HE'D
 GOTTEN
 HIMSELF
 INTO
 A FIGHT
 WITH
 AN AWESOMELY
 DANGEROUS
 THUG.
 NOW
 CAME
 THE
 ENJOYABLE
 PART
 - HE HAD
 SOMETHING
 TOO MEANINGFUL
 TO DEAL
 WITH,
 BUT
 THERE
 WASN'T
 MUCH
 TO DEAL
 WITH.
 AND
 JUST
 THEN
 HE THOUGHT
 OF THE
 MOST
 UNPLEASANT
 PART.
 YES,
 THEY
 HAD
 MANAGED
 TO 34  DEAL
 WITH
 THE
 BRUTAL
 AND
 CUNNING
 CASTRATOR.
 YES, THEY
 HAD
 MISSED
 SOMETHING
 IN THERE
 SOMEWHERE.
 WHERE
 WAS
 HIS
 MONEY?
 THEY'D
 FOUND
 A LOT
 OF MERCHANDISE,
 AND
 LAST
 BUT
 NOT
 LEAST,
 A LOT
 OF SHOPAHOLICS,
 THEY'D
 CAPTURED
 HIS
 MEN,
 AND
 SO ON. 
THE
 KANSAS
 CITY
 COP
 FELT
 LIKE
 A ROUND
 FOOL.
 THEY
 HAD
 ALSO
 FOUND
 THE
 DEMON
 ALTAR
 OF A FELISTER,
 BUT HE DIDN'T
 UNDERSTAND
 SUCH
 THINGS,
 SO HE DECIDED
 TO COMMISSION
 A LOCAL
 PRIEST
 TO INVESTIGATE
 THE
 MATTER
 MORE
 SERIOUSLY
 AND
 REPORT
 BACK
 TO HIM. 
AFTER
 A WHILE
 HE RECEIVED
 STARTLING
 INFORMATION
 BEYOND
 HIS
 WILDEST
 DREAMS. 
- "YOUR
 MAN,
 DETECTIVE,
 HAS
 MEDDLED
 WITH
 DEMONS
 MORE
 THAN
 YOU
 KNOW,"
 SAID
 FATHER
 TOBIAS
 GRIMLY. 
- "I
 DON'T
 BELIEVE
 IN AN AFTERLIFE,
 NOR
 DO I BELIEVE
 IN ANY
 DEMONS,"
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 SNAPPED. 
- "YOU
 WILL
 HAVE
 TO," THE
 PRIEST
 SCRATCHED
 THE
 BACK
 OF HIS
 HEAD,
 "OR
 YOU
 WILL
 NEVER
 UNRAVEL
 THE
 DEMONIC
 ILLUSION." 
- "THE
 DEMONIC
 ...?,"
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 REPEATED. 
- "EXACTLY,"
 CONFIRMED
 THE
 FATHER. 
- "SO FELISTER
 WASN'T
 CONTENT
 JUST
 TO COLLECT
 THE
 MANGIES,
 HE WANTED
 SOMETHING
 MORE.
 A GREEDY
 SCOUNDREL,
 AND
 A REAL
 DOWNRIGHT
 WICKED
 MAN,"
 FUMED
 THE
 COP. 
- "DON'T
 USE
 SUCH
 LANGUAGE
 IN MY PRESENCE,
 IF YOU
 PLEASE,"
 FATHER
 TOBIAS
 ASKED
 HIM
 STERNLY.
 "HE WANTED
 TO ACQUIRE
 CERTAIN
 POWERS,
 AND
 THAT
 WAS
 OF THE
 UTMOST
 IMPORTANCE
 TO HIM.
 IN THE
 END,
 HE MADE
 IT ALL
 THESE
 YEARS,
 WHICH
 IS MORE
 THAN
 COMMENDABLE." 
35  - "YOU
 MEAN
 SOMEONE
 WOULD
 STORM
 HIS
 HOME
 FOR A REASON
 OTHER
 THAN
 DRUGS,"
 DONOVAN
 WAS
 AMAZED. 

- "EXACTLY,"
 LAUGHED
 THE
 FATHER,
 "BUT
 THIS
 JOB
 IS RESPONSIBLE
 AND
 DANGEROUS.
 LOOK,
 I'M
 NOT
 AN EXORCIST
 - ALTHOUGH
 I UNDERSTAND
 THIS
 MATTER
 AND
 MY TASK
 IS TOO SIMPLE.
 I HAD
 TO INFORM
 YOU
 AND
 NOTHING
 MORE." 
THIS
 TIME
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 WAS
 GLOWING.
 HE DIDN'T
 CARE
 ABOUT
 GHOSTS,
 DEMONS
 AND
 SO ON,
 BUT HE DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO BE ACCUSED
 OF DOING
 HIS
 JOB
 THROUGH
 HIS
 FINGERS.
 THAT
 WAS
 UNACCEPTABLE.
 NO MATTER
 HOW
 MUCH
 HE TRIED
 TO CLEAR
 HIS
 MIND,
 HE KEPT
 COMING
 TO THE
 SAME
 IDEA. 
- "WELL,
 WELL,"
 HE FINALLY
 COULDN'T
 HELP
 HIMSELF,
 "WHO
 IS THIS
 FELISTER
 - THAT,
 MY DEAR
 DETECTIVE,
 YOU
 WILL
 FIND
 OUT,
 OR PERHAPS
 YOU
 WILL
 PERISH. 
DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 DID
 NOT
 BELIEVE
 IN CURSES,
 SUPERSTITIONS,
 OR IDLE
 TALK
 AND
 THREATS.
 BUT HE DECIDED
 TO TAKE
 THINGS
 TO HEART
 FROM
 A PROFESSIONAL
 STANDPOINT.
 AND
 ONE
 THING
 WAS
 GIVING
 HIM
 PEACE
 OF MIND
 - NO,
 IT WASN'T
 THE
 MONEY,
 IT WAS
 SOMETHING
 ELSE. 
FELISTER
 WAS
 A MEAN
 AND
 BRUTAL
 BASTARD
 WHO
 DEFINITELY
 KNEW
 WHAT
 HE WANTED
 AND
 HOW
 TO GET
 IT.
 PERHAPS
 THERE
 REALLY
 WAS
 SOME
 CRUEL
 AFTERLIFE
 CURSE,
 AND
 THE
 POLICE
 OFFICER
 HIMSELF
 WAS
 ABOUT
 TO FALL
 VICTIM
 TO IT. 
THE
 DETECTIVE
 DECIDED
 TO LOOK
 THROUGH
 THE
 DEMONIC
 ARTIFACTS
 OF FELISTER
 AND
 SAW
 SOME
 GRIMOIRES
 AND
 OTHER
 STRANGE
 AND
 OCCULT
 LITERATURE. 
36  "JUST
 A BRUTAL
 QUITTER
 AND
 CON
 MAN,
 AND
 A PIG
 CASTRATOR
 TO BOOT!" 
DONOVAN
 HAD
 SERIOUSLY
 FELT
 THE
 PLUSES
 OF HIS
 IMPRESSIVE
 PROMOTION
 AND
 WAS
 TRYING
 TO CASH
 THEM
 IN AS BEST
 HE COULD. 
THE
 BOSSES
 FROM
 THE
 STATE
 CAPITAL
 HAD SUGGESTED
 TO HIM
 THAT
 NOTHING
 AMAZING
 WAS
 EXPECTED
 OF HIM
 EXCEPT
 TO BE ON THE
 SPOT
 AND
 DEAL
 WITH
 THE
 GROWING
 CURIOSITY
 SURROUNDING
 THE
 TOMB.
 THAT,
 OF COURSE,
 WAS
 HIS
 REAL
 JOB. 
THERE
 WAS
 SOME
 SORT
 OF ANCIENT
 PAGAN
 TOMB
 UNDERNEATH
 FELISTER
'S FARM,
 AND
 APPARENTLY
 THERE
 WERE
 ARTIFACTS
 OF DEMONIC
 ORIGIN
 THERE. 
FELISTER
 WAS
 ONE
 HELL
 OF A FUCKING
 VINDICTIVE
 SON
 OF A BITCH
 WHO
 KNEW
 DAMN
 WELL
 THE
 COPS
 HAD
 WIPED
 OUT
 THE
 WRONG
 GUY. 
DONOVAN
 EXAMINED
 THE
 STRANGE
 SHAPE
 OF THE
 OBJECTS
 - AMONG
 THEM
 WERE,
 IN ADDITION
 TO THE
 AFOREMENTIONED
 GRIMOIRES
 - SOME
 OF THEM
 OF TOO
 GOOD
 A QUALITY,
 OCCULT
 SIGNS
 AND
 MEDALLIONS
 FOR SUMMONING
 THE
 APPROPRIATE
 DEMONIC
 POWERS. 
THE
 DETECTIVE
 WAS
 NOT
 PARTICULARLY
 IMPRESSED,
 FOR WHAT
 HE HAD
 SEEN WAS
 NOT
 UNHEARD
 OF. BUT HE PAUSED
 OVER
 A PARTICULAR
 PASSAGE
 IN ONE
 OF THE
 GRIMOIRES. 
''THE
 ANCIENT
 OF THE
 ANCIENT
 LAND, 
OLDER
 THAN
 I COULD
 HAVE
 GUESSED, 
GIVE
 ME MIGHT
 AT THY
 COMMAND, 
TO WORK
 MY SPELL.
'' 37  DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 WONDERED
 WHAT
 THIS
 CHILDISH
 NONSENSE
 WAS,
 BUT IN TIME
 BEGAN
 TO REALIZE
 THAT
 THINGS
 WERE
 MUCH
 MORE
 SERIOUS.
 IT LOOKED
 LIKE
 WICCAN
 MAGIC
 TO HIM
 - NOT
 ANYTHING
 TOO
 COMPLICATED,
 BUT
 FROM
 WHAT
 HE REALIZED
 WAS
 THAT
 THE
 SPIRITUAL
 POWERS
 OF A FELISTER
 HAD
 APPARENTLY
 PLACED
 CERTAIN
 CURSES
 AFTER
 HIM. 
AFTER
 SUMMONING
 A FEW
 TRUSTED
 PEOPLE,
 HE REALIZED
 THAT
 THERE
 WAS
 AN ENTIRE
 UNDERGROUND
 COMPLEX
 BENEATH
 THE
 RUINS
 OF FELISTER
'S HOUSE,
 AND
 BEHIND
 HIS
 SMALL,
 WELL-INSULATED
 CLOSET
 BEGAN
 UNDERGROUND
 PASSAG
ES THAT
 LED
 WHO
 KNEW
 WHERE. 
- THAT
 SICK
 BASTARD
 KNEW
 EXACTLY
 WHAT
 HE WAS
 DOING.
 AND
 PLAYED
 COMPLETELY
 APART
 FROM
 HIS
 PATRONS. 

THE
 COMPOUND
 BENEATH
 THE
 FARM,
 AND
 MORE
 PRECISELY
 BENEATH
 FELISTER
'S HOUSE
 ITSELF,
 MUST
 HAVE
 COVERED
 SEVERAL
 ACRES,
 AND
 PERHAPS
 MUCH MORE. 

- "HOW
 COULD
 A HUMAN
 HAND
 HAVE
 BUILT
 SUCH
 A THING?,"
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 WAS
 AMAZED.
 "I THINK
 IT'S
 TOO
 LATE
 TO GO BACK,
 BECAUSE
 OBVIOUSLY
 THINGS
 HAVE
 GONE
 TOO FAR.
 HE WAS
 WORKING
 ENTIRELY
 FOR HIMSELF,
 AND
 WAS
 ONLY
 RETURNING
 SOME
 OF THE
 GOODS
 TO MEXICO." 
THEY
 HAD
 TOURED
 THE
 ENTIRE
 UNDERGROUND
 COMPLEX,
 WHICH
 WAS
 MORE
 THAN
 GORGEOUS
 - THAT'S
 HOW
 IMPRESSIVE
 AND
 GOOD IT WAS.
 BUT THERE
 WAS
 SOMETHING
 THAT
 BOTHERED
 HIM.
 HE STILL
 COULDN'T
 FIGURE
 OUT
 WHAT
 KIND
 OF PERSON
 FELISTER
 WAS.
 HE LOOKED
 LIKE
 SOMEONE
 WITH
 NOT
 A DOUBLE
 BOTTOM,
 BUT EVEN
 A TRIPLE
 BOTTOM.
 A COMPLETE
 MYSTERY. 
IN ONE
 OF THE
 WELL-INSULATED
 ROOMS
 OF THE
 HUGE
 UNDERGROUND
 DRUG LAB
 OF FELISTER
 THERE
 WAS
 A 38  SMALL
 INSCRIPTION
 IN A SORT
 OF CHAPEL
 "WHOEVER
 IS WORTHY,
 HE SHALL
 TAKE
 THE
 INHERITANCE!
 AND
 THEN
 HE WILL
 KNOW
 WELL
 WHAT
 TO DO WITH
 IT. TO THOSE
 WHO
 WOULD
 TRY
 TO REMOVE
 ME,
 I WILL
 SAY
 THAT
 THEY
 WON'T
 GET
 TOO
 FAR
 EITHER!" 
HERE
 DONOVAN
 NO LONGER
 FELT
 A SHRED
 OF DOUBT
 THAT
 THE
 JOB
 WAS
 SERIOUS,
 AND
 DECIDED
 TO SET
 A TRAP
 AROUND
 THE
 PSYCHOPATH'S
 HOUSE
 - THAT
 WAS
 HOW
 HE QUALIFIED
 FELISTER.
 MAYBE
 THEY
 HADN'T
 CAUGHT
 EVERYONE
 IN THE
 ORGANIZED
 POLICE
 RAID,
 OR MAYBE
 THIS
 DEMONIC
 ILLUS
ION WAS
 BEYOND
 HIS
 CONCEPTION
 OF WHAT
 WAS
 POSSIBLE
 - EITHER
 WAY
 IT WAS
 EXTREMELY
 DANGEROUS. 
WALKING
 AROUND
 THE
 UNDERGROUND
 FACILITY,
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 NOTICED
 THAT
 AS LARGE
 AS IT WAS,
 HE SEEMED TO SEE NEW
 AND
 UNEXPLAINED
 THINGS
 EACH
 TIME,
 AND
 IN THE
 END
 HE KEPT
 RETURNING
 TO THE
 PREVIOUS
 LOCATION.
 MAYBE
 THIS
 PLACE
 HAD
 A SOUL
 OF ITS
 OWN? 
THEY
 WANTED
 THE
 APPROPRIATE
 BALLISTICS
 EXPERTISE
 TO DEAL
 WITH
 ANY
 SUSPICIONS
 THEY
 MIGHT
 HAVE.
 IN THEIR
 OPINION,
 FELISTER
 HADN'T
 USED
 ANY
 WEAPONS,
 BUT THAT
 WASN'T
 EXACTLY
 HOW
 THIN
GS STOOD
 DOWN
 HERE.
 THERE
 WERE
 OBVIOUS
 TRACES
 OF THE
 ARSENAL
 THAT
 HAD
 BEEN
 USED
 BY THE
 BRUTAL
 FARMER. 

TO TELL
 YOU
 THE
 TRUTH
 I'VE
 ALWAYS
 LOVED
 DOGS
 MORE
 THAN
 PEOPLE
 - AT LEAST
 THEY
 DON'T
 WANT
 TO TAKE
 YOURS.
 BUT
 HUMANS
 ARE
 AS HYPOCRITICAL
 AS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
 TO IMAGINE.
 WHAT
 WOULD
 YOU
 DO IF THE
 ROAD
 IN FRONT
 OF YOU
 WAS
 COMPLETELY
 BROKEN
 AND
 NOTHING
 COULD
 FIX
 IT?
 YOU
 CAN'T
 FIX
 IT,
 SO TO SPEAK! 

FELISTER
 HAD
 GATHERED
 THESE
 CONDEMNED
 SOULS
 TOGETHER,
 AND
 WISHED
 TO FIND
 A KIND
 OF SOLACE
 39  FOR HIS
 SOUL,
 WHICH
 LONGED
 TO
 GET
 AWAY
 FROM
 THIS
 LOATHSOME
 LIFE!
 ONCE
 AND
 FOR ALL! 
I SOMETIMES
 DREAMED
 OF A BLACK
 HAND
 REACHING
 OUT
 TO ME AND
 TRYING
 TO SNATCH
 ME AWAY
 AS I SLEPT.
 IT WAS
 BLOODY
 STUPID
 AND
 DISGUSTING!
 WHY
 ARE
 WE HERE?
 BECAUSE
 WE HAD
 MORE
 WORK
 TO DO!
 WHEN
 SHE
 WAS
 DONE,
 WE'D
 LEAVE
 QUIETLY
 - WITHOUT
 DISTURBING
 ANYONE. 
I PRAYED
 TO GOD,
 BUT
 IN TIME
 I CLEARLY
 REALIZED
 THAT
 IT WAS
 OF LITTLE
 USE
 - I WAS
 POURING
 OUT
 MY SOUL
 AGAINST
 A PICTURE.
 THE
 PICTURE
 AROUND
 ME WAS
 EVEN UGLIER.
 I DON'T
 THINK
 THAT
 SO MANY
 PEOPLE
 WOULD
 HAVE
 SAID
 THAT
 THEY
 MISSED
 ME, OR THAT
 THEY
 COULDN'T
 GO ON WITHOUT
 ME. 
DONOVAN
 CLEARLY
 SENSED
 THE
 CHANGE
 IN THE
 SITUATION,
 BUT
 DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO INDULGE
 HIS
 SENSE
 OF SHAME.
 HE KNEW
 THAT
 FELISTER
 HAD
 BEEN
 DRIVEN
 BY HIS
 INNER
 DEMONS
 TO TAKE
 THIS
 DECISIVE
 STEP,
 BUT THAT
 DIDN'T
 STOP
 HIM
 FROM
 ADMITTING
 THAT
 FELISTER
 HAD
 TURNED
 OUT
 TO BE A MUCH
 BIGGER
 MAN
 THAN
 HE HAD
 EVER LET
 ON.
 HE WASN'T
 A SAINT,
 BUT
 A MAN
 WILLING
 TO EXIST
 IN HIS
 OWN
 LITTLE
 WELL-BUILT
 WORLD,
 AND
 WHEN
 THAT
 WORLD
 WAS
 DESTROYED,
 HE WAS
 SIMPLY
 GONE
 - LIKE
 SO MANY
 OTHERS
 BEFORE
 HIM! 

USUALLY
 THE
 REBEL
 IMAGINES
 HIS
 DEMISE
 IN HEROIC
 TERMS,
 BUT FROM
 THE
 SIDE
 HE MAY
 SEEM TOO PATHETIC
 FOR
 MANY.
 SUCH
 WAS
 FELISTER.
 A FALSE
 KNIGHT! 

HIS
 FAMILY
 WAS
 ONE
 OF THE
 STRANGEST
 THAT
 COULD
 HAVE
 EXISTED.
 HIS
 FATHER-THAT
 WRETCH!
 WAS
 A DRUNKARD
 AND
 A BRUTAL
 RUFFIAN-A
 FREQUENT
 GUEST
 OF THE
 POLICE.
 AND
 HIS
 MOTHER
 A LOST
 SOUL!
 FELISTER
 FELT
 SO WRETCHED
 AND
 FORSAKEN!
 SAD
 AND
 GLOOMY
 THAT
 HE WAS
 NOT
 LIKE
 THE
 REST!
 40  SOMEWHERE
 IN THE
 DEPTHS
 OF HIS
 TWISTED
 MIND
 HE FELT
 THAT
 ALL
 MEN WERE
 CREATURES
 OF LIGHT,
 BUT
 IN REALITY
 THE
 REALITY
 WAS
 OTHERWISE
 - AND
 IT TORMENTED
 HIM
 GREATLY.
 NOT
 EVERYONE
 GOT THE
 SAME
 CHANCE
 - AND
 THAT
 WAS
 TRUE. 
DONOVAN
 WAS
 DISGUSTED
 - SO FELISTER
 MIGHT
 EVEN
 HAVE
 BEEN
 GOOD AS A CHILD!
 HE HAD
 A SIMILAR
 CHANCE,
 BUT NEVER
 GOT A CHANCE
 TO SHOW
 HIS
 DISTINCTIVE
 QUALITIES! 
DEMON
 CULTS
 WERE
 A STRANGE
 BUSINESS
 - THEY
 COULD
 BURN YOUR
 SOUL,
 BUT
 THEY
 COULD
 ALSO
 GIVE
 YOU
 A SENSE
 THAT
 YOU'D
 GOTTEN
 HELP
 FROM
 SOMEWHERE. 

FELISTER
 WAS
 DOOMED
 FROM
 A YOUNG
 AGE
 - JUST
 A LOST
 SOUL. 
IT WAS
 SAID
 THAT
 THE SOULS
 OF PEOPLE
 WHO
 HAD UNFINISHED
 BUSINESS
 IN THIS
 WORLD
 WENT
 AROUND
 THE
 EARTH
 FOREVER,
 SUFFERING
 AND
 PRAYING
 TO BE FORGIVEN
 AND
 GIVEN
 THE
 RIGHT
 TO A NEW
 LIFE. 
MANY
 ASPIRED
 TO RECEIVE
 SOME
 FORM
 OF SPIRITUAL
 VINDICATION,
 BUT FEW
 WOULD
 SUCCEED
 IN EARNING
 IT. 
A NEW
 LIFE?
 NEW
 LIFE?
 NEW
 LIFE?
 WHAT
 WAS
 THAT? 
THE
 DEMONIC
 CULT
 SEEMED
 TO BE SOMETHING
 THAT
 MIGHT
 BE WASTING
 SOME
 PEOPLE'S
 TIME,
 BUT
 IT WAS
 BY NO MEANS
 AN ANNOYING
 DETAIL
 THAT
 DONOVAN
 WAS
 GOING
 TO LEAVE
 JUST
 LIKE
 THAT. 
THEY
 FOUND
 MANY
 ARTIFACTS,
 BUT
 DONOVAN
 DIDN'T
 BOTHER
 TO DESCRIBE
 THEM
 OR VERIFY
 THEIR
 SIGNIFICANCE.
 HE JUST
 DECIDED
 HE HAD
 PEOPLE
 FOR
 THE
 JOB.
 APPARENTLY
 HIS
 BOSSES
 WOULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 PLEASED. 

AFTER
 SURFACING
 AGAIN,
 HE TOOK
 A BREATH
 OF FRESH
 AIR!
 WHAT
 A RELIEF! 
41  MISSOURI
 WAS
 ONE
 HELL
 OF A DANGEROUS
 AND
 BRUTAL
 STATE!
 MU MOM!
 EVERYTHING
 HAD
 TO BE SORTED
 OUT
 SOMEHOW! 
THE
 DETECTIVE
 GAZED
 AT THE
 BEAUTIFUL
 SUNSET-
BRUTALLY
 REAL
 AND
 SENSITIVE,
 TOUCHING
 HIS
 SOUL!
 HE LOOKED
 AND
 LOOKED,
 AND
 FELT
 THAT
 SOMETHING
 WAS
 LEFT
 UNSAID-PERHAPS
 HE HAD
 FAILED
 TO CATCH
 THE
 SOUL
 OF THIS
 MAN.
 MAYBE... 
FELISTER
 KNEW
 HOW
 TO REPAY
 HIS
 ENEMIES
 EVEN FROM
 BEYOND
 THE
 GRAVE! 
I COULD
 SENSE
 THAT
 SOMEWHERE
 IN THERE,
 SOMETHING
 WAS
 CHANGING
 DRASTICALLY.
 AND
 EVEN THOUGH
 I COULDN'T
 WITNESS
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN'S
 FEELINGS,
 I COULD
 SEE EVERYTHING
 CLEARLY
 ENOUGH. 

 
CHAPTER
 FIVE:
 THE
 WOMAN
 IN RED 
 
THE
 DEAL
 I HAD
 STRUCK
 WITH
 THE
 WOMAN
 IN RED
 WAS
 IMPRESSIVE.
 SHE
 WAS
 GOING
 TO GRANT
 ME THE
 LEGACY
 OF A FELISTER,
 AND
 I WAS
 GOING
 TO BE THE
 CONDUIT
 BETWEEN
 IT AND
 THE
 AFTERLIFE
 AND
 THIS
 WORLD.
 IT SOUNDED
 SHADY,
 BUT
 I WAS
 TOLD
 THAT
 THIS
 WAS
 MY DESTINY. 
OVER
 TIME,
 THIS
 WOMAN
 GAVE
 ME THE
 IMPRESSION
 THAT
 SHE
 WAS
 PECULIAR
 TO SAY
 THE
 LEAST.
 I DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO ASK
 HER
 WHERE
 SHE
 HAD
 ACTUALLY
 GOTTEN
 THE
 INFORMATION
 ABOUT
 THE
 FELISTER
 HIMSELF,
 NOR
 WHAT
 WAS
 BEHIND
 THE
 PLOT. 
- YOU
 KNOW
 THAT
 FELISTER
 LOVED
 YOU-
IN HIS
 OWN
 WAY,
 BUT HE LOVED
 YOU
 ALL
 THE
 SAME!
 YOU
 WERE
 HIS
 ESCAPE
 FROM
 REALITY. 
42  I GRITTED
 MY TEETH!
 SHE
 WAS
 RIGHT.
 I AGREED
 TO DO A SPIRITUALIST
 S43  - "WHERE
 IS YOUR
 INHERITANCE

 THE
 WOMAN
 REPEATED
 LESS
 CONFIDENTLY,
 TRYING
 TO FIND
 OUT
 AS MUCH
 AS SHE
 COULD
 FROM
 THE
 SPIRIT. 
- "WELL,
 THAT'S
 A QUESTION
 THAT
 HAS
 NO EXACT
 ANSWE
R," THE
 GHOST
 STAMMERED. 
- "AT LEAST
 TRY
 TO DIRECT
 US,"
 SHE
 INSISTED. 
- "IF YOU
 WANT
 THE
 MONEY,"
 THE
 GHOST
 CONTINUED
 IN THE
 SAME
 MONOTONE
 STYLE,
 - "THEN,
 YOU
 WILL
 EASILY
 TAKE
 IT.
 THEY
 ARE
 IN...
 " 
JUST
 THEN
 SOMETHING
 FEATHERED
 THE
 SPIRIT-BOARD.
 AND
 THE
 SESSION
 BROKE
 UP. 
- "SHALL
 WE LOOK FOR IT AGAIN
, I WONDERED
 HYPOCRITICALLY,
 "PERHAPS
 HE HAS
 SOME
 PLANS
 AND
 DOESN'T
 WANT
 TO SHARE
 THEM
 WITH
 US." 
- "OPPOSITE.
 'I'M
 CONVINCED
 HE'LL
 SAY
 ABSOLUTELY
 ANYTHING,"
 THE
 WOMAN
 IN RED
 TURNED
 TO ME. WE TRIED
 AGAIN. 
THIS TIME
 THE
 GHOST
 REALLY
 POINTED
 THE
 PLACE
 OUT
 TO US.
 IT WAS
 SOMEWHERE
 BETWEEN
 MISSOURI
 AND
 OHIO. 

- "IT'S
 GOING
 TO TAKE
 A LONG
 TIME
 TO GET
 THERE,"
 I TURNED
 TO HER. 
- "DON'T
 WORRY,
 WE HAVE
 PEOPLE
 EVERYWHERE,"
 WAS
 HER
 CURT REPLY.
 "WHERE
 FELISTER
 LEFT
 SOMETHING,
 THERE'S
 PROBABLY
 SOMETHING
 ELSE
 HIDING." 

THEN
 THE
 FOLLOWING
 SONG
 WAS
 HEARD
 IN THE
 BACKGROUND: 
''WEARING
 A THONG, 
WHEREVER
 I GO, 
44  I HAVE
 NOT
 A MOMENT'S
 REST, 
MY SPIRIT
 IS NOT
 FOR
 HERE. 
YOU
 FORGOT
 ME, 
BUT ALWAYS
 REMEMBER 
THE
 GOOD
 OLD
 DAYS!
'' I LOOKED
 AROUND
 AND
 NOTICED
 NO ONE
 AROUND.
 IT WAS
 DAMN
 DESERTED.
 THEN
 THE
 WOMAN
 IN RED
 TURNED
 TO ME AND
 SAID. 
- WE'RE
 GOING
 TO FIND
 FELISTER
'S WILL
 AND
 HIS
 LEGACY.
 WE WILL
 SOON
 REGAIN
 OUR
 POSITION
 AND
 EVERYTHING
 WILL
 GO BACK
 TO THE
 WAY
 IT WAS! 
- "IT SOUNDS
 LIKE
 AN ADVENTURE,
 ONLY
 I'VE
 NOT
 BEEN
 A FAN
 OF THAT
 SORT
 OF NONSENSE
 FOR
 A LONG
 TIME,"
 I UTTERED,
 TORTURED
 AND
 DRAWN
 OUT,
 "WHAT
 I WANT
 IS AN ANSWER
 TO MY QUESTIONS." 
SHE
 LOOKED
 AT ME QUESTIONINGLY
 - FOR
 THE
 THIRD
 TIME: 

- OK! 
MEANWHILE,
 THIS
 WHOLE
 SPIRITUALIST
 SESSION
 HAD BEEN
 TAKING
 PLACE
 IN HER
 HACIENDA,
 AS SHE
 CALLED
 IT. 

LIKE
 ANY
 HACIENDA,
 THE
 VAST
 ESTATE
 HAD
 EVERYTHING
 AND
 ALSO
 HAD
 ITS STABLES,
 BARNS
 AND
 STOREROOMS. 

- "NOW
 GO AND
 REST,"
 SAID
 MY STEWARDESS
 TO ME,
 "TONIGHT
 WE WILL
 TALK
 IN MORE
 DETAIL." 
I FELT
 THE
 ADRENALINE
 RUSH.
 APPARENTLY,
 WE WERE
 GOING
 TO GO SEARCHING
 FOR
 FELISTER
'S REAL
 FACE. 
45  "WILL
 YOU
 GROW
 UP WITH
 ME?,"
 LIKE
 THE
 REFRAIN
 OF SOME
 FORGOTTEN
 SONG. 
SADNESS
 HAS
 THE
 FOLLOWING
 PROPERTY.
 IT LINGERS
 IN OUR
 SOUL
 ONLY
 IF WE LET
 IT.
 THROUGH
 THE
 EYES
 OF SADNESS
 WE SEE THE
 WORLD
 DIFFERENTLY. 
THERE
 WAS
 NOTHING
 TO BE DONE,
 I RETIRED
 TO MY GUARDIAN'S
 CHAMBERS.
 I REALIZED
 THAT
 MY LIFE
 WAS
 A COMPLETE
 LIE
 AND
 FELT
 LIKE
 I WAS
 IN A MOVIE
 THAT
 WAS
 JUST
 GOING
 TO END
 - WHETHER
 SOONER
 OR LATER
 DIDN'T
 REALLY
 MATTER. 
I FELL
 ASLEEP
 AND
 HAD
 A DISGUSTING
 NIGHTMARE.
 SOMEWHERE
 THERE
 WAS
 A RIVERBED
 - THE
 MOON
 REFLECTED
 IN ITS
 MIRRORED
 SURFACE.
 THERE
 WERE
 PEOPLE
 AROUND,
 BUT
 THEY
 WERE
 SOMEWHERE
 FAR
 AWAY
 - LIKE
 BARELY
 NOTICEABLE
 SPECKS.
 I WAS
 ALONE.
 IT WAS
 SO BEAUTIFUL
 AND PLEASANT,
 BUT
 I COULD
 TASTE
 THE
 STRANGE
 TASTE
 IN
 MY MOUTH.
 WAS
 THAT
 THE
 GHOST? 
THOSE
 WHO
 WERE
 INVOLVED
 IN DEMONOLOGY
 AND
 OCCULTISM
 KNEW
 THIS.
 THE
 WHOLE
 ESSENCE
 OF COMMUNICATION
 WITH
 THE
 AFTERLIFE,
 BASED
 ON OUR
 DESIRE
 TO LEARN
 MORE
 AND
 FEEL
 SOMETHING
 THAT
 IS MOST
 LIKELY
 NOT
 THERE. 
I SLEPT
 LIKE
 A SLAUGHTERED
 MAN.
 I'M
 SIMPLY
 UNABLE
 TO GIVE
 A DIFFERENT
 DEFINITION
 FOR THE
 TIME
 SPENT
 DURING
 WHICH
 MY SENSES
 HAD
 TIME
 TO RELAX
 AND
 EXPECT
 SOMEONE
 TO POINT
 A GUN
 AT MY TEMPLE.
 AND
 DESPITE
 THE
 NIGHTMARES,
 WHEN
 MY BEAUTIFUL
 GUARDIAN
 CAME
 TO WAKE
 ME, I WAS
 SUFFICIENTLY
 RESTED. 

- "BRACE
 YOURSELF,"
 SHE
 INSTRUCTED
 ME GRAVELY.
 "WE HAVEN'T
 MUCH
 TIME
 TO LOSE." 
WE HAD
 RECEIVED
 INFORMATION
 THAT
 SOME
 OF THE
 CARTELS
 OPERATING
 OFF
 THE
 GULF
 OF MEXICO
 COULD
 46  HARM
 OUR
 SECURITY.
 A LITTLE
 LATER
 WE LEFT
 THE
 MANSION. 

BUT,
 THEN
 I REALIZED
 ONE
 THING
 - I COULD
 TRUST
 THIS
 WOMAN.
 SHE
 KNEW
 WHERE
 SHE
 WAS
 GOING
 AND
 WHAT
 SHE
 WANTED
 OUT
 OF LIFE,
 AND
 I DIDN'T. 
FELISTER
 WAS
 MY STARTING
 POINT
 FOR SO MANY
 THINGS
 THAT
 MADE
 ME FEEL
 LIKE
 PART
 OF A BADLY
 ORDERED
 PUZZLE.
 BUT IN TIME,
 I REALIZED
 IT WAS
 NOT
 OKAY
 TO BE OVERLY
 CRITICAL
 OF MY LATE
 BENEFACTOR.
 FELISTER
 WAS
 AN ANGEL
 TO SOME
 AND
 A DEVIL
 TO OTHERS! 
I FIGURED
 THAT
 GETTING
 US ACROSS
 THE
 BORDER
 WAS
 GOING
 TO BE TRICKIER
 THIS
 TIME. 
THE
 MEXICAN
 BORDER
 IS ONE
 OF THE
 MOST
 PICTURESQUE
 PLACES.
 BUT
 ALSO
 ONE
 OF THE
 MOST
 DANGEROUS.
 USUALLY
 THE
 MERCHANDISE
 TRAVELED
 TO PHOENIX
 ARIZONA
 AS THE
 SONORA
 DESERT,
 WHICH
 WAS
 IN MEXICAN
 TERRITORY,
 WAS
 ALSO
 CONDUCIVE
 TO DRUG TRAFFICKING.
 TUCSON,
 YOU
 COULD
 SAY,
 WAS
 ALSO
 PART
 OF THE ROUTE,
 BUT
 WE COULDN'T
 STAY
 THERE
 AS MANY
 OF THE
 PEOPLE
 KNEW
 ME.
 THERE
 WERE
 A LOT
 OF FORMER
 FELISTER
 ASSOCIATES
 THERE.
 IT WOULDN'T
 HAVE
 DONE
 ME ANY
 GOOD IF ANY
 OF THEM
 HAD
 BAD
 MEMORIES
 OF ME. 
I HAD
 HEARD
 THAT
 SOME
 OF THE
 MOST
 BRUTAL
 KILLERS,
 DESTROYED
 THE BODIES
 OF THE
 INCONVENIENT
 IN BARRELS
 OF ACID.
 BUT STILL,
 WE WERE
 ON AMERICAN
 SOIL.
 THE
 LAWS
 OF CIVILIZATION
 WERE
 AT WORK
 HERE!
  AND
 THE
 IDEA
 OF A DRUG DISTRIBUTION
 ZONE
 WAS
 HARDLY
 A COMPLETE
 SOLUTION
 TO THE
 PROBLEM
 EITHER. 

DON'T
 ASK
 ME HOW
 THE
 CORRUPT
 CUSTOMS
 OFFICIALS
 MISSED
 US BECAUSE
 THAT'S
 ANOTHER
 TOPIC.
 BUT
 47  APPARENTLY
 MY PATRON
 HAD
 CONNECTIONS
 ALL
 OVER
 THE
 PLACE
 AND
 HER
 WORD
 OPENED
 TOO
 MANY
 DOORS.
 OF COURSE,
 I DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO KNOW
 EXACTLY
 HOW
 FAR
 HER
 INFLUENCE
 EXTENDED. 
I KNEW,
 HOWEVER,
 THAT
 SHE
 WAS
 COUNTING
 ON US TO FIND
 THE
 INHERITANCE
 AND
 WOULD
 MAKE
 A DEFINITE
 EFFORT
 TO MAKE
 THAT
 HAPPEN.
 I COULD
 NOT,
 HOWEVER,
 IMAGINE
 WHAT
 THAT
 "OTHER"
 SHE
 HAD
 HINTED
 AT WOULD
 BE. 
FELIX
 WAS
 ALSO
 MORE
 DANGEROUS
 THAN
 A VIPER
 SNAKE
 - SO ABSOLUTELY
 ANYTHING
 COULD
 BE EXPECTED
 OF HIM.
 EVEN FROM
 THE
 CURSED
 GRAVE
 THEY'D
 SHOVED
 HIM
 INTO! 
TO TELL
 YOU
 THE
 TRUTH,
 AT THAT
 MOMENT
 I IMAGINED
 WORMS
 WORKING
 THEIR
 WAY
 THROUGH
 HIS
 GNAWED
 EYEBALLS
 AND
 I FELT
 SICK. 
THE
 ZONE
 LOOKED
 AT ME KIND
 OF SOURLY.
  - I'M
 NAMED
 AFTER
 THAT
 MOTH
 THAT
 DESTROYS
 EVERYTHING
 IT TOUCHES
 - SO FELISTER
 WILL
 TEST
 MY TEMPER. 

I DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO CONTRADICT
 HER.
 SHE
 HAD
 EVIDENTLY
 MADE
 UP HER
 MIND
 TO DO AS SHE
 PLEASED,
 AND
 WOULD
 DO IT IN SPITE
 OF MY OPINION
 OR ATTITUDE. 
IT ONLY
 MADE
 ONE THING
 CLEAR
 TO ME. FELISTER
'S ROAD
 DOWN
 WAS
 EVIDENTLY
 A VERY,
 VERY
 LONG
 ONE.
 AND
 IN FOLLOWING
 THAT
 PATH
 HE WAS
 COMPLETELY
 ALONE. 

SEE, ALTHOUGH
 I LOVED
 FELISTER
 I COULDN'T
 SAY
 MY TEARS
 FOR HIM
 WERE
 SINCERE.
 IN THE
 END
 HE HAD
 ENDED
 UP WHERE
 HE HAD
 WISHED
 TO
 BE!
 AND
 THIS
 IN HIS
 CONFUSED
 MIND
 WAS
 APPARENTLY
 PERFECTLY
 LOGICAL! 
48  I WOULD
 DESCRIBE
 THE
 SITUATION
 IN THE
 MEXICAN
 DRUG CARTELS
 AS VIOLENCE
 WITHOUT
 END,
 WHERE
 THE
 STATE
 WAS
 CLEARLY
 LOSING
 THE
 WAR
 AGAINST
 THE
 MORE
 POWERFUL
 GANGS. 
FELISTER,
 HOWEVER,
 WAS
 ALSO
 A DEMONIC
 FOLLOWER.
 HE HAD
 PAID
 WITH
 HIS
 SOUL
 FOR SOME
 AFTERLIFE
 KNOWLEDGE
 THAT
 WAS
 OBVIOUSLY
 MORE
 VALUABLE
 AND
 INTERESTING
 TO HIM
 THAN
 SOME
 PAPERS. 

AS I WATCHED
 ZONARA'S
 ENTHUSIASM
 I COULD
 SEE WHY
 SHE
 WAS
 SO INTRIGUED.
 WE WERE
 OBVIOUSLY
 INTERESTED
 IN SOME OF THAT
 KNOWLEDGE,
 AND
 MAYBE
 EVEN ALL
 OF IT. 
SHE
 MENTIONED
 TO ME THAT
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 HAD
 RECEIVED
 SOME
 OF THE
 FELISTER
'S OWN
 WORKINGS,
 AND
 CLEARLY
 FELT
 A KEEN
 INTEREST
 IN WHAT
 HE WAS
 UP TO. THE
 NON-PUKISM
 WITH
 WHICH
 SHE
 SPOKE
 OF INSTITUTIONS
 WAS
 MORE
 THAN
 IMPRESSIVE.
 SHE
 HAD
 BEEN
 BORN
 TO IT! 
WE DECIDED
 TO DETOUR
 OUR
 ORIGINAL
 ROUTE
 BECAUSE
 THERE
 MIGHT
 BE SOME
 DRUG CARTEL
 MEMBERS
 ON OUR
 TRAIL,
 AND
 WE DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO GET
 HAMMERED
 FOR ANYTHING! 
SOMEWHERE
 IN THERE
 I SENSED
 SOMETHING
 ELSE. 
I REMEMBERED
 THAT
 ZONARA
 HAD
 TALKED
 TO ME ABOUT
 SOME
 GIANT
 CRASH
 THAT
 MEMBERS
 OF A RIVAL
 CARTEL
 HAD
 ORCHESTRATED.
 AND
 THEN,
 GETTING
 OUT
 OF THE
 CARS,
 THEY
 THREW
 COCKTAILS
 OF INCENDIARY
 LIQUID
 AT MEMBERS
 OF A RIVAL
 GANG,
 SMASHING
 THE
 WINDOWS
 OF THE
 CARS
 WITH
 CLUBS. 
SOME
 OF THE PEOPLE
 BURNED
 LIKE
 LIVE
 COALS! 
49  - "THEY
 REALLY
 KNOW
 NO MERCY!,"
 ZONARA
 LAUGHED
 MYSTERIOUSLY,
 BUT
 I KNEW
 THERE
 WAS
 SOME
 SADNESS
 IN HER
 SMILE,
 "THEY
 LOST
 THEIR
 ABILITY
 TO LOVE
 SO LONG
 AGO!
 AND
 WHO
 CAN
 TELL
 YOU
 WHAT
 NEED
 OF LOVE
 IS BUT
 ONE
 WHO
 HAS
 LONG
 BEEN
 HOPELESSLY
 DOOMED
 - "TELL
 ME ABOUT
 THIS
 DEMONIC
 CULT,"
 I INQUIRED.
 "I'M
 SURE
 THE
 CUNNING
 FELISTER
 HAS
 OTHER
 SECRETS
 UP HIS
 SLEEVE.
 THIS
 MAN
 IS A REAL
 DEVIL.
 PEACE
 BE UPON
 HIM!" 

SHE
 LAUGHED,
 SHOWING
 ME HER
 EVEN
 WHITE
 TEETH.
 SHE
 LOOKED
 YOUNGER
 SOMEHOW,
 AND
 SOME
 STRANGE
 THOUGHT
 SHADOWED
 HER
 BROW.
 WHO
 KNOWS
 WHAT
 SHE
 EXPECTED
 FROM
 ME! - "FELISTER
'S LEGACY
 IS VERY
 IMPORTANT
 FOR A NUMBER
 OF REASONS,"
 SHE
 TOLD ME,
 "BUT
 THE
 MOST
 IMPORTANT
 IS THAT
 WE WILL
 BE ABLE
 TO PLAY
 HIS
 GAME
 BY HIS
 RULES." 
- "AND
 WHAT
 WILL
 BE OUR
 USE?,"
 SAID
 I, ASTONISHED.
 "THAT
 SOUNDS
 UTTERLY
 MAD!" 
- "YOU
 SEE THERE
 ARE
 TOO
 MANY
 LOST
 SOULS
 IN THIS
 WORLD?,"
 ZONARA
 TURNED
 TO ME COMPLETELY
 SERIOUSLY,
 "OUR
 JOB
 IS TO BRING
 THEM
 BACK
 AND
 SUCCEED
 IN CLAIMING
 THEM
 THE
 RIGHT
 TO A NEW
 LIFE!" 
- 'SO THAT
 SOUNDS
 BLOODY
 CRAZY
 TO ME,'
 I SMILED,
 'WHY
 SHOULD
 WE HELP
 ANY
 SOULS
 OF OUR
 OWN?
 WHAT
 GOOD IS IT TO US ANYWAY?
 AND
 WHERE
 WILL
 ALL
 THIS
 WORK
 GO? 
- THE
 PROBLEM
 IS THAT
 TOO MANY
 PEOPLE
 HAVE
 NO REAL
 DESIRE
 TO LIVE.
 SOME
 OF THEM
 DON'T
 EVEN UNDERSTAND
 THAT
 THEY'VE
 BEEN
 WALKING
 AROUND
 LIKE
 THE
 LIVING
 DEAD
 ALL
 THEIR
 LIVES,
 AND
 THAT'S
 TOO
 DAMAGING
 TO THEIR
 ASTRAL
 DEVELOPMENT.
 I THINK
 THAT'S
 WHAT
 FELISTER
 WAS
 GETTING
 AT.
 HE 50  WANTED
 TO SAVE
 THEIR
 SOULS,
 AND
 HE USED
 THE
 DRUG MONEY
 TO DO JUST
 THAT. 
I HAD A FEELING
 THAT
 ZONARA
 HAD
 COMPLETELY
 LOST
 IT.
 SO IF IT WAS
 ALL
 TRUE,
 IT MEANT
 ONLY
 ONE
 THING
 - WE WOULD
 BE TRYING
 TO REHABILITATE
 THE
 MONSTER
 FELISTER,
 AND
 IN A WAY
 THAT
 MANY
 WOULD
 NOT
 PERCEIVE
 - EVEN AMONG
 FORMER
 DRUG LORDS,
 THERE
 WAS
 SOME
 FORM
 OF CODE
 OF HONOR
 BEFORE
 EVERYTHING
 COLLAPSED
 AND
 WENT
 TO HELL.
 THEN
 EVERYONE
 DECLARED
 TOTAL
 WAR
 ON EACH
 OTHER.
 THERE
 WAS
 NO LONGER
 ANY
 PREDICTABILITY
 IN THEIR
 RELATIONSHIPS
 AND
 THE
 KILLINGS
 GOT COMPLETELY
 OUT
 OF HAND.
 AFTER
 ALL,
 MANY
 OF THE
 DRUG CARTELS
 WERE
 FOUNDED
 BY EX-MILITARY
 MEN EAGER
 TO GRAB
 SOME
 OF THE
 DRUG
 MARKET.
 AND
 WHEN
 THE
 SITUATION
 CHANGED,
 THEY
 HAD
 TO ADAPT
 TO IT. 
MEXICAN
 COOKS
 HAD
 RAISED
 THEIR
 LEVEL
 AS THEIR
 CHINESE
 COUNTERPARTS
 HAD
 TAUGHT
 THEM
 SOME
 TRICKS
 AND
 COULD
 KNEAD
 HEROIN
 AND
 FENTANYL,
 WHICH
 MADE
 IT MANY
 TIMES
 STRONGER.
 THIS
 POWERFUL
 OPIOID
 GREATLY
 ALTERED
 ITS
 PROPERTIES
 AND
 MADE
 IT MUCH
 MORE
 DESIRABLE
 ON THE
 US MARKET,
 AND
 HENCE
 PROFITS
 SKYROCKETED. 
BUT ZONARA
 DIDN'T
 CARE
 ABOUT
 THE
 DRUG MARKET
 AT ALL.
 NO,
 SHE
 WANTED
 TO GO TOE-TO-TOE
 WITH
 FELISTER,
 THE
 MONSTER
 WHO
 WAS
 THE
 FACE
 OF ALL
 THE
 POWERFUL
 CARTELS
 IN THE
 US.
 THE
 BRUTAL
 BASTARD
 WHO
 LIVED
 LIKE
 A RABID
 DOG
 AND
 QUITE
 RIGHTLY
 TOOK
 A BULLET
 IN THE
 FOREHEAD. 
- "THE
 WAY
 OF SOULS
 IS PARTICULAR,"
 ZONARA
 TOLD
 ME, ALL
 TOO
 CONFIDENTLY.
 "NOT
 EVERYONE
 BELIEVES
 IN ORTHODOXY.
 BUT
 THOSE
 WHO
 HAVE
 FALLEN
 IN BATTLE
 WILL
 BE REBORN,
 AND
 THIS
 HAS
 LONG
 BEEN
 KNOWN.
 BUT
 FELISTER
 WAS
 DEALING
 WITH
 SOMETHING
 PARTICULARLY
 INTERESTING.
 HE HAS
 SUMMONED
 51 
 DEMONS
 TO AID
 HIM
 AND
 GIVE
 HIM
 POWERS
 TO GUIDE
 THESE
 SOULS
 ON THE
IR JOURNEY
 TO THE
 AFTERLIFE." 
- "BUT
 WHY
 DID
 HE DO IT AT ALL
, I WONDERED,
 "IT
 WAS
 BRUTALLY
 DANGEROUS
 AND
 HIS
 BODY
 WAS
 IN DANGER
 OF BEING
 POSSESSED." 
- "THAT
 WASN'T
 HIS
 ULTIMATE
 GOAL,"
 ZONARA
 ASSURED
 ME, "FELISTER
 WAS
 UTTERLY
 DEVOTED
 TO HIS
 CAUSE,
 AND
 THE FINANCES
 FROM
 THE
 CARTELS
 SIMPLY
 HELPED
 HIM
 SURVIVE.
 REMEMBER
 HIS
 UNDERGROUND
 CLOSET
 THAT
 WAS
 BROKEN
 INTO
 BY DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN.
 FELISTER
 DIDN'T
 SET
 OUT
 TO DESTROY
 ENERGY,
 AS THAT
 WAS
 IMPOSSIBLE
 IN PRINCIPLE,
 BUT
 ONLY
 TO PROCESS
 IT,
 OR AT LEAST
 TRY
 TO." 

I LISTENED
 RAPTLY
 TO HER
 STRANGE
 RAMBLINGS,
 THE
 WORDS
 OF A WOMAN
 POSSESSED
 WHO
 HAD
 RESOLUTELY
 MADE
 UP HER
 MIND
 TO GO ALL
 THE
 WAY
 IN HER
 QUEST,
 AND
 I WAS
 TO BE HER
 HELPER. 
 
CHAPTER
 SIX:
 THE
 PHILOSOPHY
 OF THE
 CASTRATOR 
 
TO BREATHE
 FREE
 AIR
 HAD ALWAYS
 BEEN
 ATTRACTIVE
 TO ME,
 ESPECIALLY
 IN THOSE
 ROMANTIC
 YEARS
 ON FELISTER
'S FARM.
 HE LONGED
 TO SHOW
 US THE
 RIGHT
 WAY,
 THOUGH
 THIS
 WAY
 WAS
 TOO
 FLEETING. 
- "ROMANCE,"
 FELISTER
 WAS
 SAYING,
 "IS
 GOOD
 FOR A TIME,
 BUT
 IN THE
 END,
 ASK
 YOURSELF
 WHO
 NEEDS
 YOU
 IN THIS
 LIFE.
 MOST
 OF YOU
 ONLY
 KNOW
 THE
 PETTY
 THEFTS
 IN THE
 MISSOURI
 AREA,
 OR SOME
 OF THE
 BETTER
 CONCEIVED
 HYPERMARKET
 ROBBERIES
 AND
 SUCH.
 YOU'RE
 USED
 TO THE
 POLICE
 CHASING
 YOU,
 SIRENS
 BLARING,
 AND
 YOU
 FEELING
 LIKE
 HEROES
 WHO
 ARE
 CARRYING
 OUT
 SOME
 IMPORTANT
 MISSION,
 AND
 AT 52  THE
 END
 REPORTING
 THE
 MONEY
 TO YOUR
 BOSS.
 SOME
 OF YOU
 HAVE
 ALSO
 BEEN
 ARRESTED
 AS DRUG DEALERS,
 WHICH
 ELEVATED
 THEM
 TO THE
 RANK OF ASSISTANT
 CASTRATORS
 ON MY FARM." 
THE
 HARDENED
 CATTLE
 WATCHED
 HIM
 IN RAPT
 FASCINATION,
 EAGER
 TO FEEL
 THAT
 THRILL
 OF BLUE
 SPRING
 THAT
 WAS
 TO REVIVE
 THEM.
 THEY
 KNEW
 NOT
 HOW
 TO GO ON WITH
 THEIR
 LIVES,
 FOR THEY
 KNEW
 HOW
 TO DO NOTHING
 BUT
 CRIME.
 BUT
 THERE
 WAS
 A PSYCHOLOGICAL
 POINT
 HERE,
 WHICH
 FELISTER,
 AS A SUBTLE
 AND
 ADROIT
 PSYCHOLOGIST,
 USED
 ADMIRABLY.
 HE DID
 NOT
 GIVE
 THEM
 THE
 HOPE
 THAT
 HE WAS
 THEIR
 FATHER,
 OR THEIR
 MENTOR,
 OR THEIR
 SPIRITUAL
 TEACHER,
 BUT AN EQUAL
 PARTNER
 - A KIND
 OF COMMON
 WORK
 BOUND
 THEM
 TOGETHER,
 AND
 THEY
 BELIEVED
 THAT
 THEY
 WERE
 ALMOST
 GOD-CHOSEN
 BECAUSE
 THEY
 HAD
 FALLEN
 INTO
 THE
 NET
 OF THE
 CARTELS
 THAT
 HELD
 SUCH
 IMPORTANT
 PORTS
 AS THE
 ALREADY
 MENTIONED
 LAZARO
 CARDENAS. 
THE
 SADNESS
 IN FELISTER
'S EYES
 WAS
 VAGUELY
 EVIDENT,
 AND
 HE SOUGHT
 TO GAIN
 FORGIVENESS
 FROM
 THOSE
 DEMONS
 WHOM
 HE THOUGHT
 MIGHT
 HOLD
 THE
 REINS
 FIGURATIVELY
 SPEAKING.
 HE WORKED
 THROUGH
 SPIRITUALISTIC
 SEANCES
 WITH
 MARBAS,
 ABRAXIS,
 AGARES
 AND
 MANY
 OTHER
 DEMONS,
 BUT
 HE ALSO
 LIKED
 TO DO WHAT
 WAS
 CALLED
 CHANNELING
 ENERGY,
 WHICH
 MEANT
 THAT
 WHILE
 HE WAS
 IN CAPTIVITY
 THE SPIRIT
 COULD
 "FULFILL"
 SOME
 OF HIS
 WISHES.
 IT WASN'T
 PARTICULARLY
 ACCURATE
 TO SAY,
 BUT IN PRACTICE,
 FELISTER
 COULD
 RECEIVE
 SOME
 INFORMATION
 THAT
 HE THOUGHT
 MIGHT
 HELP
 HIM
 IN HIS
 WORK
 WITH
 THE
 AFTERLIFE. 
HIS
 COMPANIONS
 DIDN'T
 EVEN SUSPECT
 HIS
 OCCUPATIONS
 THOUGH
 SOME
 VAGUELY
 GUESSED
 AND
 CRAVED
 SOME
 FORM
 OF COMPENSATION
 ESPECIALLY
 WHEN
 THE
 FARM
 WORK
 WAS
 IN EXCESS.
 THE
 STARTLING
 THING
 WAS
 THAT
 FAR
 TOO
 MANY
 OF THEM
 53  WERE
 WILLING
 TO STAY
 EVEN OVERTIME,
 WHICH
 WAS
 SUSPICIOUS
 TO SAY
 THE
 LEAST.
 FELISTER
 HAD
 BEEN
 PARTICULARLY
 ATTENTIVE
 TO HIS
 GRIMOIRES,
 WHICH
 HE HAD
 BOUGHT
 AT SOME
 OF THE
 MOST
 INTERESTING
 BOOK
 AUCTIONS
 - USUALLY
 MOST
 OF THEM
 COMPLETELY
 ANONYMOUS.
 THE
 PRICE
 OF THE
 MOST
 EXPENSIVE
 OF THEM
 RAN
 TO OVER
 THREE
 HUNDRED
 THOUSAND
 DOLLARS,
 AND
 FELISTER
 HAD
 SERIO
US CONCERNS
 THAT
 SOMEONE
 MIGHT
 BLOW
 THE
 BOOK
 IN THE
 MOST
 BRUTAL
 WAY,
 SO HE HAD
 TAKEN
 MEASURES
 AGAINST
 ITS
 THEFT.
 THE
 SIMPLEST
 AND
 RATHER
 CRUDE METHOD
 WAS
 THAT
 HE HAD
 LEFT
 A SPIRIT-BOARD
 NEAR
 THE
 GRIMOIRES,
 THE
 SUMMONED
 DEMON
 BEING
 TRICKED
 BY THE
 VIOLENT
 SHAKING
 OF THE
 SPIRIT-
BOARD
 AND
 ITS
 SYMBOLIC
 RITUAL
 BURNING
 - SO HE COULD
 NOT
 LEAVE
 THIS
 WORLD.
 BUT
 FELISTER
 WAS
 ALSO
 SKILLED
 IN NECROMANCY,
 AND
 HAD
 DONE
 SOME
 ADDITIONAL
 SPELLS
 WHERE
 HE USED
 THE
 DEAD
 AS WEAPONS
 - IT WASN'T
 VERY
 ORIGINAL,
 BUT
 THEN
 AGAIN,
 DEMO
NS SOMETIMES
 HAD
 A HABIT
 OF BLOWING
 AWAY
 AFTER
 A WEEK
 OR SO,
 SO HE PREFERRED
 TO RELY
 ON HUMAN
 SOULS
 FOR
 HIS
 PURPOSES
 AS WELL. 
FELISTER
 HAD
 STRANGE
 FEELINGS
 AND
 ATTRACTIONS
 TO LIFE
 - A COMPLETE
 ASCETIC,
 HE WAS
 CONSIDERED
 TO BE AN EXAMPLE
 OF A TRULY
 CLEVER
 GANGSTER
 BY THE
 REST
 OF THE
 KATHILI
 WHO
 OBEYED
 HIM.
 SOMETIMES
 FELISTER
 HAD
 TO BRIBE
 SOME
 SERIOUS
 CONGRESSMEN
 WHO
 TRIED
 TO BE HIS
 EYES
 AND
 EARS
 TO THE
 AUTHORITIES
 TRYING
 TO PEEP
 INTO
 HIS
 BUSINESS,
 BUT
 SOMEWHERE
 IN THERE
 A STRANGE
 FELLOW
 BY THE
 NAME
 OF STEINER
 SHOWED
 UP.
 THE
 GERMAN
 FAMILY
 NAME
 WAS
 A GUARANTEE
 OF HIS
 DEEP
 PRECISION
 IN HIS
 WORK
 AND
 HIS
 WILLINGNESS
 TO GO INTO
 DETAIL. 
AS WE MIGHT
 GUESS,
 HE LOVED
 THE
 FOLLOWING
 FORMULATION
 "IF
 MY LIFE
 IS A LIE,
 MY DEATH
 WILL
 BE A LIE TOO!"
 AND
 WISHED
 TO KNOW
 MORE
 ABOUT
 FELISTER
 AND
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN,
 WHO
 HAD
 54  SOMEHOW
 STRANGELY
 INTERFERED
 IN HIS
 AFFAIRS
 DESPITE
 THE
 POWERFUL
 BUREAUCRATIC
 UMBRELLA
 THAT
 WAS
 STRETCHED
 WIDE
 OVER
 FELISTER. 
THE
 PEOPLE
 WHO
 PROTECTED
 HIM
 KNEW
 FULL
 WELL
 THAT
 HE NOT
 ONLY
 COULD
 PAY
 FOR THEIR
 NEXT
 ELECTION
 CAMPAIGNS,
 BUT
 WAS
 DEEPLY
 CONNECTED
 TO THE
 BUREAUCRATIC
 MACHINE
 IN THE
 STATE. 
AS A STATE,
 MISSOURI
 WAS
 ALSO
 PART
 OF THE
 SO-CALLED
 STREET-LEVEL
 BUREAUCRACY,
 WHICH
 PROVIDED
 DIRECT
 JOB
 CONTACT
 BETWEEN
 PUBLIC
 OFFICIALS
 AND
 THE
 PUBLIC.
 FELISTER
 HAD
 ANTICIPATED
 SOME
 MOVES,
 AND
 POLITICIANS
 AND
 CITIZENS
 WORKED
 IN HIS
 FAVOR.
 PUBLIC
 OPINION
 AS A RESULT
 OF CAREFULLY
 CONSTRUCTED
 PR WAS
 VERY
 IMPORTANT. 

TO TIE HIS
 PANTS,
 FELISTER
 HAD
 BUILT
 UP AN EXTENSIVE
 NETWORK
 OF FARMS
 WHERE
 ANIMAL
 CASTRATION
 TOOK
 PLACE.
 PERHAPS
 OVER
 TWO
 HUNDRED
 DIFFERENT
 FARMS
 AROUND
 THE
 COUNTRY
 WERE
 DOING
 JUST
 THAT.
 BUT
 HIS
 SLOGAN
 WAS
 ACTUALLY
 THAT
 THEY
 WERE
 DEVELOPING
 ANIMAL
 HUSBANDRY. 

LIFE'S
 FELISTER
 HAD
 UNDERSTOOD
 THAT
 NOTHING
 CAME
 FOR FREE
 AND
 THAT
 EVERY
 THING
 CAME
 AT A PRICE.
 HIS
 CATTLE
 KNEW
 IT TOO.
 ANY
 MISDEMEANOUR
 ON THEIR
 PART
 COULD
 COST
 THEM
 HANGING
 FROM
 THE
 BARN
 DOOR.
 SOME
 WERE
 EVEN BEATEN
 WITH
 A BROOM
 HANDLE.
 BUT FELISTER
 WAS
 - LIKE
 A TRUE
 EDUCATOR
 - ALL
 TOO
 AWARE
 THAT
 HIS
 EDUCATIONAL
 METHODS
 WOULD
 HAVE
 MADE
 THEM
 DO THEIR
 JOBS
 EVEN BETTER.
 YES,
 THOSE
 BASTARDS
 HATED
 HIM
 AND
 WANTED
 TO DRAG
 HIS
 GUTS
 ALL
 THE
 WAY
 TO KANSAS
 CITY
 ON THE
 ASPHALT.
 BUT
 FELISTER
 WAS JUST
 MINDING
 HIS
 OWN
 BUSINESS!
 AND
 THE
 DAYS
 WENT
 BY MONOTONOUSLY. 
55  FELISTER
 WAS
 ALSO
 A HISTORY
 BUFF
 AND
 READ
 HISTORY
 BOOKS
 VORACIOUSLY
 - NOT
 THAT
 HE HAD
 MUCH
 TIME
 FOR
 THAT.
 THE
 CARTELS
 REQUIRED
 THE
 FARM
 TO WORK
 TWENTY-FOUR-HOUR
 SHIFTS
 TO ENSURE
 HIGHER
 TURNOVER
 AND
 PROFIT.
 IN ONE
 OF THESE
 BOOKS
 HE HAD
 READ
 THE
 FOLLOWING
 FORMULATION
 "THERE
 IS NONE
 OF YOU
 BUT
 WILL
 HANG
 ME, I KNOW,
 WHENEVER
 YOU
 CAN
 TOUCH
 ME IN YOUR
 POWER.
1" SO HE TRIED
 TO MAKE
 SURE
 THE
 FORCES
 WERE
 NEVER
 EQUAL.
 AND
 THAT
 HELD
 THE
 SITUATION. 
FELISTER
 ALSO
 UNDERSTOOD
 HOW
 TO MANAGE
 HIS
 BUSINESS,
 AND
 HE ALSO
 UNDERSTOOD
 FINANCE.
 AND
 HIS
 KNOWLEDGE
 OF THE
 WHOLE
 WORLD
 ENDED
 THERE.
 BUT HE DIDN'T
 NEED
 MORE.
 HE WAS
 SELF-SUFFICIENT.
 NO MATTER
 HOW
 HARD
 THEY
 TRIED
 AND
 HOW
 MUCH
 THEY
 SAW
 HIS
 QUIRKS,
 HIS
 SUBORDINATES
 KEPT
 QUIET,
 KNOWING
 THAT
 HE WAS
 GIVING
 THEM
 THEIR
 BREAD
 AND ALSO
 PROVIDING
 THEM
 WITH
 A STABLE
 BACK
 FROM
 A FORMAL
 POINT
 OF VIEW.
 NO MATTER
 HOW
 THEY
 SPUN
 HIM
 WITH
 THEIR
 QUESTIONS,
 FELISTER
 WAS
 UNRUFFLED
 AND
 DID
 NOT
 GIVE
 IN TO ANYONE'S
 PROVOCATIONS.
 HIS
 SIMPLE
 PHILOSOPHY
 OF LIFE
 WAS
 THAT
 HE HAD
 COME
 INTO
 THIS
 WORLD
 ON A MISSION
 AND
 IT WOULD
 SOON
 BE OVER. 
DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 HAD IDENTIFIED
 HIM
 IN THE
 MORGUE
 IN NO UNCERTAIN
 TERMS,
 AS THERE
 WASN'T
 MUCH
 LEFT
 OF HIM.
 A FRAGMENTATION
 GRENADE
 THROWN
 BY ONE
 OF THE
 STORMTROOPERS
 HAD TORN
 HIS
 LEGS
 OFF
 TO ABOVE
 THE
 KNEE,
 AND
 ALSO
 PARTS
 OF HIS
 TORSO. 
THE
 MORGUE
 WAS
 CRAMPED
 AND
 OPPRESSIVE
 ENOUGH,
 AND
 EVEN THE
 WALLS
 THEMSELVES
 SEEMED
 TO WHISPER
 SECRETS.
 IT WAS
 AS IF THEY
 WERE
 SAYING
                                                
 1 Words of the famous Samuel Bellamy, known as "Black Sam", 
who was the richest pirate of all time. 
56  TO DONOVAN
 "YOU
 KILLED
 HIM!
 YOU
 WER
E! YOU!
 YOU!
 YOU!
 YOU!
 YOU!" 
DONOVAN
 WAS
 GOING
 TO THROW
 UP.
 HE WISHED
 TO GET
 OUT
 INTO
 THE
 FRESH
 AIR.
 HE WASN'T
 GETTING
 ANY
 IN THE
 GOVERNMENT
 EITHER,
 AND
 HE KNEW
 HE STILL
 HAD
 SOME
 ACTIVITY
 TO REPORT
 AND
 NOT
 LIE
 ON THOSE
 OLD LAURELS
 FOREVER. 
HE HAD
 BEEN
 GIVEN
 A PRIVATE
 OFFICE
 WHERE
 HE COULD
 DO WHATEVER
 HE WANTED
 AND
 HAD
 RECEIVED
 ALMOST
 DOUBLE
 HIS
 SALARY,
 AND AT THE
 END
 OF THE
 YEAR
 HE COULD
 HOPE
 FOR SOME
 PRETTY
 FAT
 BONUS.
 WHAT
 MORE
 COULD
 HE ASK
 FOR? 
HE COULD
 BOSS
 AROUND
 THOSE
 LOWER
 THAN
 HIM
 AND
 GET
 THE
 SATISFACTION
 OF HIS
 COMPARATIVELY
 GREAT
 POWER
 AS CHIEF
 OF POLICE.
 SO MANY
 AND
 BRUTAL
 GAINS
 OBTAINED
 AT THE
 PRICE
 OF A NOTHING
 AND
 NO DEATH
 OF A NOXIOUS
 CRIMINAL
 SCOUNDREL! 
YES, DONOVAN
 AS A PROFESSIONAL
 WAS
 TRAINED
 TO SEE THOSE
 ON THE
 OTHER
 SIDE
 OF THE
 LAW
 THAT
 WAY.
 OF THOSE
 HEINOUS
 OFFENDERS
 WHO,
 LIKE
 A BRUTAL
 CATERPILLAR 

AND
 YET SOMETHING
 BOTHERED
 HIM. 
HE HAD
 PROPERLY
 ORDERED
 A BALLISTICS
 EXAMINATION
 OF THE
 WEAPON
 THAT
 HAD
 KILLED
 FELISTER
 - NOT
 THAT
 HE NEEDED
 TO,
 BUT
 HE DECIDED
 TO DO IT JUST
 IN CASE
 BECAUSE
 HE FEARED
 FELISTER
 WOULD
 HAVE
 NO POWERFUL
 PATRONS
 HOLDING
 HIM
 TO ACCOUNT.
 HE WANTED
 TO LOOK
 IMPRESSIVE,
 AND
 HE WAS
 PUMPED
 TO STAY
 AT THE
 VERY
 TOP,
 WHERE
 MAYBE
 FORTUNE
 WOULD
 SMILE
 ON HIM
 AND
 EVEN ONE
 DAY
 ELEVATE
 HIM
 EVEN FURTHER. 
THEN
 HE ORDERED
 A STUDY
 OF THE
 GRIMOIRES
 OF HIS
 ENEMY,
 WHOM
 HE DIDN'T
 EVEN KNOW
 PERSONALLY,
 BUT THANKS
 TO WHOM
 HE HAD
 GOTTEN
 ALL
 THAT
 HE 57  HAD
 AT THE
 MOMENT,
 DONOVAN
 SEEMED TO CALM
 DOWN
 FOR A MOMENT.
 HAD
 HE BEEN
 A SMOKER,
 HE PROBABLY
 WOULD
 HAVE
 LIT
 UP A GIANT
 CIGAR
 AND PROUDLY
 LEANED
 BACK
 IN HIS
 HUGE
 AND
 RELATIVELY
 EXPENSIVE
 LEATHER
 CHAIR.
 BUT
 THE
 PROBLEM
 WAS,
 HE WASN'T
 A SMOKER.
 AND
 HE DIDN'T
 GIVE
 A DAMN
 ABOUT
 FOUR
 HUNDRED
 AND
 FIFTY
 BUCKS FOR
 CIGARS
 LIKE
 "KOHIBA,"
 WHERE
 THE
 DEEP
 AND
 DELICATE
 AROMA
 CARESSED
 NOT
 ONLY
 YOUR
 LUNGS
 BUT
 YOUR
 OVERACHIEVING
 PARVENU
 EGO.
 WELL,
 HE HAD
 BEEN
 DENOUNCED
 AT THE
 GOVERNMENT
 TROUGH
 LONG
 AGO,
 BUT HE LIKED
 TO THINK
 OF HIMSELF
 AS A PARVENU
 IN HIS
 OWN
 IMAGINATION.
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 BEEN
 CONSIDERED
 A CAPABLE
 COP,
 BUT
 IN PRACTICE
 HE HAD
 BUILT
 HIS
 IMAGE
 THAN
KS TO A LOT OF PEOPLE
 WHO
 STOOD
 BEHIND
 HIM
 AND
 BACKED
 HIM
 UP IN EARNEST. 

FOR MORE
 THAN
 FIFTEEN
 YEARS
 NOW,
 HE'D
 BEEN
 LANGUISHING
 IN THE
 SMELLY
 OFFICE,
 WHERE
 HE'D
 WAITED
 ANXIOUSLY
 FOR
 A MORE
 SERIOUS
 CASE-BUT
 THERE
 HADN'T
 BEEN
 ONE.
 WHATEVER
 HE SAID,
 DONOVAN
 WAS AMBITIOUS
 AND
 WANTED
 MORE
 FOR HIMSELF
 THAN
 HE DESERVED. 
AFTER
 A WHILE,
 SOMEONE
 CAME
 TO TELL
 HIM
 HOW
 FAR
 THEY
 HAD
 GOTTEN
 WITH
 THE
 RELIANCE
 ON THE
 GRIMOIRES.
 IT TURNED
 OUT
 TO BE OLD
 BOOKS.
 IT WAS
 THE
 ORIGINAL
 OF "ARS
 ALMADEL,"
 WHICH
 WAS
 TO HELP
 FELISTER
 SECURE
 COMMUNICATION
 WITH
 THE
 ANGELS
 WHO
 COULD
 AID
 HIM
 IN HIS
 UNDERTAKINGS.
 THIS
 WAS
 PRACTICALLY
 THE
 FOURTH
 BOOK
 OF SOLOMON'S
 LITTLE
 KEY,
 WHICH
 GAVE
 PROFOUND
 KNOWLEDGE
 TO THE
 PRACTITIONER. 
DONOVAN
 JUST
 SCRATCHED
 HIS
 HEAD.
 THESE
 SIMPLE
 THINGS
 WERE
 CLEARLY
 GETTING
 TO HIM.
 BUT
 HE NOTICED
 SOMETHING
 - NONE
 OF THE
 CONGRESSMEN
 CAME
 TO CONGRATULATE
 HIM
 ON A JOB
 SO WELL
 DONE.
 ALL
 HE GOT
 WAS
 AN OFFICIAL
 CONGRATULATIONS
 AND
 58  NOTHING
 MORE
 - NOT
 THAT
 HE EXPECTED
 THOSE
 GOD-ANOINTED
 SOULS
 TO PAY
 MUCH
 ATTENTION
 TO HIM,
 BUT
 THE SPECIAL
 OPERATION
 HE HAD
 ORGANIZED
 WAS
 CARRIED
 OUT
 LIKE
 A TEXTBOOK.
 NOT
 TO MENTION
 THAT
 HE HAD
 PUT
 HIS
 WHOLE
 SOUL
 INTO
 IT. 
IT SEEMED
 TO HIM
 THAT
 THE
 OTHER
 ASSISTANTS
 IN THE
 POLICE
 FORCE
 ALSO
 HAD
 LITTLE
 PARTICULAR
 REGARD
 FOR HIS
 ASPIRATIONS
 FOR PROMOTION.
 DONOVAN,
 HOWEVER,
 DID
 NOT
 CARE.
 HE ALWAYS
 ARRIVED
 AT WORK
 IN A PERFECTLY
 PRESSED
 SUIT
 AND
 WAS
 VERY
 ATTENTIVE
 TO DETAIL. 
DONOVAN
 LOOKED
 FORWARD
 TO THE
 END
 OF THE
 WORKDAY
 SO HE COULD
 GET
 HOME
 FROM
 WORK
 AND
 GET
 SOME
 SLEEP.
 EVEN
 IN HIS
 OFFICE
 HE WAS
 ALERT,
 BECAUSE
 SOMETIMES
 REPORTS
 CAME
 IN OF SOME
 BRUTAL
 CRIMES,
 SUCH
 AS BEATINGS
 FOR THE
 PURPOSE
 OF ROBBERY
 OR EVEN ARSON. 
DONOVAN
 KNEW
 THAT
 KANSAS
 CITY
 WAS
 NOT
 A BAD
 PLACE
 TO INDULGE
 IN A BIT
 OF FUN,
 BUT
 ACCORDING
 TO OFFICIAL
 RANKINGS
 IT WAS
 THE
 FIFTH
 MOST
 DANGEROUS
 CITY
 IN THE
 US. 
THE
 COP
 HAD
 A SMALL
 CABIN
 NOT
 FAR
 FROM
 KANSAS
 CITY-MAYBE
 THIRTY
 MILES
 SOUTHEAST
 OF THE
 METROPOLIS.
 IT WAS
 A MASSIVE
 TWO-STORY
 STRUCTURE,
 AND
 BECAUSE
 HE HAD
 SOME
 CONNECTIONS,
 DONOVAN
 DECIDED
 TO TAKE
 ADVANTAGE
 OF THE
 SITUATION
 AND
 STAKE
 OUT THE
 LAND
 AROUND
 IT.
 IT WASN'T
 MUCH
 LAND
 MAYBE
 ABOUT
 THREE
 OR FOUR
 ACRES
 BUT HE WAS
 EAGER
 TO DO SOMETHING
 AND
 DIDN'T
 WANT
 ANYONE
 WATCHING
 HIM. 
WHY
 HAD
 FELISTER
 ALLOWED
 HIMSELF
 TO BE CAPTURED?
 WHY
 HAD
 NO ONE
 DEMANDED
 AN ACCOUNT
 OF THE
 DONOVAN?
 WERE
 THE
 PEOPLE
 BEHIND
 THIS
 GIGANTIC
 DRUG DEAL
 NOT
 LISTENING? 
59  SOMETHING
 DIDN'T
 ADD
 UP HERE
 AND
 IT DIDN'T
 ADD
 UP AT ALL.
 NO MATTER
 HOW
 HARD
 HE TRIED
 TO FIGURE
 IT OUT,
 DONOVAN
 WAS
 UNABLE
 TO ARRIVE
 AT THE
 FULL
 TRUTH
 ON HIS
 OWN. 
- "FELISTER
 SEEMS
 TO HAVE
 BEEN
 A REAL
 MAVERICK,"
 HE MUTTERED,
 STARING
 INTO
 THE
 FIREPLACE,
 WHICH
 WAS
 CRACKLING
 MERRILY. 
IT WAS
 A HELLISH
 HEAT,
 BUT
 THE
 HUT WAS
 SOMEHOW
 COOL,
 AND
 YET
 THE
 DETECTIVE'S
 SEEMINGLY
 MADE-
UP STORY
 WAS
 FICTIONAL,
 BUT
 HE WANTED
 TO REACH
 THE
 INSIGHTS
 OF FELISTER,
 HIS
 MORTAL
 AND
 RUTHLESS
 ENEMY,
 FOR HIMSELF. 
- "FIRE
 PURIFIES,"
 HE SAID,
 AS IF IN A TRANCE,
 AND
 BEGAN
 TO UNWRAP
 THE
 GRIMOIRE
 WHICH,
 WHO
 KNEW
 WHY,
 WAS
 IN HIS
 HANDS. 
YES, THAT'S
 RIGHT,
 HE HAD
 TAKEN
 IT BECAUSE
 HE WAS
 CLEARLY
 AWARE
 THAT
 HE NEEDED
 IT.
 THE
 SAME
 BOOK
 WAS
 KEPT
 AS PHYSICAL
 EVIDENCE,
 BUT DONOVAN
 HAD
 PHOTOGRAPHED
 IT WITH
 A SPECIAL 
CAMERA
 AND
 HAD
 ASSEMBLED
 THE
 PRINTED
 MATERIAL,
 SHAPING
 IT CAREFULLY
 INTO
 A BOOK. 
IT WASN'T
 LONG
 BEFORE
 HE REALIZED
 THE
 MOST
 IMPORTANT
 THING
 - FELISTER
 HADN'T
 BEEN
 TRYING
 TO COMMUNICATE
 WITH
 THE
 DEMONS
 HE'D
 BEEN
 COMMUNICATING
 WITH
 ALL
 HIS
 LIFE,
 BUT
 WITH THE
 ANGELS
 WHO
 SEEMED TO HAVE
 FORGOTTEN
 HIM. 
THE
 COP
 WONDERED
 WHY
 FELISTER
 WAS
 SO DETERMINED
 TO HELP
 THE
 OTHERS.
 PERHAPS
 SOME
 OF THE
 SOULS
 WERE
 IN FACT
 IN NEED,
 BUT IT WASN'T
 THE
 CASTRATOR
 WHO
 WAS
 BEST
 SUITED
 FOR THIS. 
DONOVAN
 HAD
 ALSO
 TAKEN
 SOME
 OF THE
 SHRUNKEN
 MAGE'S
 NOTES,
 WHICH
 HAD
 ALSO
 BEEN
 DUTIFULLY
 SCANNED
 WITHOUT
 HIS
 COLLEAGUES'
 KNOWLEDGE.
 HE 60  WANTED
 TO EXAMINE
 THEM
 IN PEACE
 AND
 FIGURE
 OUT
 WHAT
 WAS
 BEHIND
 IT ALL. 
 
CHAPTER
 SEVEN:
 THE
 FELISTER
'S LEGACY 
 
THE
 MORE
 HE CONSIDERED
 DONOVAN,
 THE
 MORE
 HE FOUND
 THAT
 THERE
 WAS
 SOMETHING
 VERY,
 VERY
 ROTTEN
 HERE.
 JUST
 TO KEEP
 YOU
 GUESSING.
 NOWHERE
 COULD
 HE CATCH
 THE
 LOGIC
 OF FELISTER
'S THOUGHT,
 AND
 HE WAS
 SURE
 THERE
 WAS
 ONE.
 THEN,
 UNEXPECTEDLY,
 IN ONE
 OF THE
 MANY
 PASSAGES,
 HE CAME
 ACROSS
 SOME
 VERY
 DISTANT
 HINT
 OF HIS
 HERITAGE.
 ACCORDING
 TO FELISTER
'S INSTRUCTIONS,
 IT WAS
 LOCATED
 SOMEWHERE
 BETWEEN
 THE
 STATES
 OF MISSOURI
 AND
 OHIO
 - THE
 SAME
 INFORMATION
 ZONARA
 HAD
 SHARED
 WITH
 ME. THE
 MESSAGE
 SAID
 THE
 FOLLOWING: 
"WHOEVER
 FINDS
 THE
 INHERITANCE
 WILL
 ALSO
 INHERIT
 MY SORROW.
 HE WHO
 FACES
 DEATH
 WILL
 REALIZE
 HIS
 INNER
 STRENGTH.
 AND
 HE WHO
 GOES
 AGAINST
 THE
 WILL
 OF THE
 GODS
 WILL
 SUFFER!" 
DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 DID
 NOT
 SEE HOW
 THE
 CONFUSED
 INSTRUCTIONS
 COULD
 BE OF ANY
 USE
 TO HIM.
 ILLINOIS
 AND
 INDIANA
 WERE
 LOCATED
 BETWEEN
 MISSOURI
 AND
 OHIO,
 BUT
 EVEN THAT
 INFORMATION
 WAS
 TOO
 GENERAL. 

- "DAMN
 IT!"
 ROARED
 DONOVAN.
 "THAT
 DIRTY
 BASTARD
 SURE
 KNOWS
 HOW
 TO PLAY
 THOSE
 GAMES!" 
AND
 WITH
 A FURIOUS
 SHOUT
 HE SENT
 THE
 REMAINING
 PAPERS
 INTO
 THE
 FIREPLACE.
 FLAMES
 ROSE
 UP,
 ALMOST
 SETTING
 THE
 FLOOR
 ON FIRE. 
61  DONOVAN
 WAS
 BEGINNING
 TO SUSPECT
 THAT
 FELISTER
'S LEGACY
 WAS
 TO GET
 THEM
 INTO
 A GAME
 THAT
 WAS
 PLAYED
 BY SOME
 RULES
 OF HIS OWN,
 BUT WHAT
 EXACTLY? 
THE
 SEARCH
 OF THE
 COTTAGE
 HAD
 FOUND
 ABSOLUTELY
 NO MONEY,
 NOR
 ANY
 PARTICULAR
 VALUABLES,
 LET
 ALONE
 HUNTING
 TROPHIES
 OR ANYTHING
 ELSE.
 ALL
 THAT
 WAS
 LEFT
 WAS
 THE
 MERCHANDISE,
 WHICH
 HAD
 TO BE DISPOSED
 OF IN DUE ORDER. 

- "SICK
 BRAIN!,"
 SHOUTED
 DONOVAN,
 "THERE
 IS OBVIOUSLY
 SOMETHING
 MUCH
 DEEPER
 HERE!" 
ALL
 THE
 TIME
 THE
 WOMAN
 IN RED
 WAS
 TRYING
 TO CONVINCE
 ME THAT
 I SHOULD
 ACCEPT
 HER
 OFFER. 
- "WE'LL
 SPLIT
 FIFTY-FIFTY,"
 SHE
 TOLD
 ME CONFIDENTLY. 

I WAS
 UNABLE
 TO FATHOM
 WHAT
 WAS
 THE
 POINT
 OF USING
 ME FOR
 CANNON
 FODDER
 EXCEPT
 TO SAVE
 MY OWN
 SKIN. 
- "I
 ASSUME
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 WILL
 BE HOT
 ON OUR
 HEELS
 AS WELL,
 AND
 WE'LL
 HAVE
 TO BEAT
 HIM
 TO IT,"
 SHE
 ADDED,
 TRYING
 TO IGNORE
 MY PROTESTS
 TO JOIN
 IN,
 PROMPTED
 BY MY BEWILDERMENT. 
- "HOW
 LITTLE
 IT TAKES
 FOR
 A MAN
 TO BE HAPPY,"
 I SAID
 QUIETLY
 IN AN ATTEMPT
 TO CONVINCE
 EVEN MYSELF. 
AS WE BREATHED
 THE
 FREE
 AMERICAN
 AIR,
 WE HAD
 LONG
 SINCE
 LEFT
 PHOENIX,
 ARIZONA,
 AND
 WERE
 NOW
 ENTERING
 ANOTHER
 STATE,
 BUT
 SOMETHING
 WAS
 BOTHERING
 ME. THERE
 WAS
 NO TAIL
 ON OUR
 HEELS,
 AND
 ZONARA
 HADN'T
 EVEN TAKEN
 A GUARD
 TO PROTECT
 US IN CASE
 OF ACCIDENTS. 
- "WHAT
 THE
 HELL
 WAS
 GOING
 ON?,"
 I DIDN'T
 FLINCH.
 "THINGS
 MIGHT
 GET
 OUT
 OF HAND. 
62  - "RELAX,
 YOU'RE
 TRAVELLING
 BACK
 TO YOUR
 ROOTS,
 WHICH
 ISN'T
 SO BAD,"
 SHE
 TOLD
 ME WITH
 SOME
 COMPASSION. 

I KNEW
 ZONARA
 WAS
 CAPABLE
 OF ALL
 SORTS
 OF CRUELTY
 AND
 RAMPAGES.
 SHE'D
 PROBABLY
 ALSO
 ORDERED
 SOMEONE
 TO BE SOAKED
 IN A VAT
 OF ACID,
 BUT I DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO QUESTION
 HER. 
- "YOU
 KNOW,
 ONE
 GETS
 NUMB
 AND
 STARTS
 TO FEEL
 LIFE
 DIFFERENTLY?,"
 SHE
 TOLD
 ME. "DON'T
 TELL
 ME YOUR
 MIND
 DOESN'T
 FEEL
 ANY
 REMORSE." 
I THOUGHT.
 FELISTER
 HAD
 FLOGGED
 HIS
 MISCREANTS,
 ONCE
 EVEN CRUSHING
 A PRISONER'S
 HEAD
 WITH
 A ROCK,
 BUT
 HE WAS
 NEVER
 LATE
 IN DELIVERING
 DOPE
 TO THE
 MEXICAN
 CARTELS. 
- "OKAY,
 LET'S
 PLAY
 CARDS,"
 I TRIED
 TO BE SERIOUS,
 "WHAT
 EXACTLY
 DO YOU
 KNOW
 THAT
 YOU'RE
 NOT
 TELLING
 ME? I'M
 SURE
 SOMEWHERE
 DEEP
 DOWN
 YOU'RE
 HARBORING
 SOMETHING
 ELSE
 ABOUT
 FELISTER,
 BUT
 YOU'RE
 NOT
 SHARING
 IT." 
WE HAD
 ALREADY
 ENTERED
 UTAH,
 AND
 IT WAS
 A PLACE
 THAT
 RARELY
 OCCURRED
 TO EVEN
 THE
 AMERICANS
 THEMSELVES.
 THIS
 STATE
 REPRESENTED
 THE
 FAR
 WILD
 WEST
 - SUCH
 AS IT WAS!
 HERE
 THERE
 WERE
 CANYONS
 AND
 MANY
 BIZARRE
 ROCK
 FORMATIONS. 
WE HAD
 TO STOP
 FOR A MOMENT
 TO REFUEL. 
WE PULLED
 OFF
 ON HIGHWAY
 SEVENTY,
 BUT
 WE WERE
 MAKING
 FALSE
 TURNS
 THAT
 WERE
 MEANT
 TO DOUBLE
 CHECK
 WHETHER
 OR NOT
 THERE
 WAS
 A QUEUE
 BEHIND
 US. 

HERE
 FOR THE
 FIRST
 TIME
 ZONARA
 GOT
 RESTLESS
 AND
 I COULD
 CLEARLY
 SENSE
 THAT
 SOMETHING
 WAS
 BOTHERING
 HER.
 APPARENTLY
 IT WASN'T
 JUST
 THE
 SECRET
 SHE
 WAS
 GUARDING
 TOO
 JEALOUSLY
 FROM
 63  ME, AND
 WHICH
 I WOULD
 PROBABLY
 NEVER,
 EVER KNOW. 

- THE
 TRUTH
 WAS,
 FELISTER
 OWED
 TOO
 MUCH
 MONEY
 TO RIVAL
 CARTELS.
 SOME
 OF THEM
 WANTED
 HIM
 TO CHANGE
 HIS
 TRADE
 POLICY
 TOWARD
 THEM,
 BUT
 HE WAS
 STRETCHING.
 THEY
 WERE
 WILLING
 TO FORGIVE
 HIM
 IF ONLY
 FOR THAT
 AND
 KEEP
 WORKI
NG WITH
 HIM.
 BUT HE CRINGED
 AND
 POINTED
 OUT
 THAT
 NOTHING
 COULD
 CHANGE
 HIS
 MIND,
 AND
 DEMONIC
 CONTROL
 OVER
 THOSE
 ENTITIES
 WOULD
 HAVE
 HIS
 BACK. 
I WAS
 STARTING
 TO GET
 CONFUSED
 - WE WERE
 SUPPOSEDLY
 LOOKING
 FOR
 FELISTER
'S LEGACY,
 AND
 HE PROBABLY
 HAD
 DEBTS.
 SOMETHING
 DIDN'T
 QUITE
 ADD
 UP. 
- "SEE,"
 ZONARA
 TURNED
 BACK
 TO ME, "FELISTER
 PAID
 OFF
 EVERYTHING
 HE OWED
 AND
 EVERYTHING
 IS FINE.
 HE IS NOT
 INDEBTED
 TO ANYONE.
 AT LEAST
 NOT
 IN THIS
 WORLD!
 IF HE HAS
 TO PAY,
 HE WILL PAY
 IN THE
 AFTERLIFE!" 

WE DROVE
 ALONG
 THE
 HIGHWAY,
 WHICH
 WAS
 QUITE
 DESERTED.
 THE
 STERN
 DESOLATION
 OF NATURE
 WAS
 REVEALED
 AROUND
 US,
 WHICH
 SUGGESTED
 THAT
 SADNESS
 OF WHICH
 FELISTER
 SPOKE. 
AT ONE
 TIME,
 HOWEVER,
 WE REALIZED
 THAT
 WE DID
 HAVE
 A TAIL
 - HOW
 THEY
 HAD
 BEEN
 HIDING
 FROM
 US ALL
 THIS
 TIME
 WE NEVER
 KNEW. THE
 VEHICLE
 WAS
 A BLACK
 CHEVY,
 WHICH
 WAS
 SO BRUTALLY
 EQUIPPED
 FOR THESE
 DESERT
 CONDITIONS
 THAT
 YOUR
 MIND
 BOGGLES! 
THEY
 TRIED
 TO RUN US OFF THE
 ROAD,
 BUT
 ULTIMATELY
 FAILED.
 APPARENTLY
 THEIR
 GOAL
 WAS
 TO GET
 BETWEEN
 US AND
 THE
 OPPOSITE
 LANE
 AND
 PUSH
 US OUT
 OF THE
 WAY,
 LIKE
 THEY
 DID
 IN THE
 MOVIES. 
64  THEN
 SOMETHING
 UNEXPECTED
 HAPPENED.
 THE
 WOMAN
 IN RED
 LOADED
 HER
 SECRET
 CURSES,
 WHICH
 SHE
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 LEARNED
 FROM
 FELISTER,
 AND
 THE
 CAR
 LAGGED
 SLIGHTLY
 BEHIND
 - APPARENTLY
 THE
 DRIVER
 HAD
 FALLEN
 VICTIM
 TO HER
 ENERGY
 INTERFERENCE. 

WE PULLED
 THE
 VEHICLE
 OVER
 AND
 SHE
 TURNED
 TO ME: - YOU
 SEE FOR YOURSELF
 THAT
 THE
 PARTY
 HAS
 BEGUN.
 THEY
 ARE
 UNLIKELY
 TO LEAVE
 US LOCATED. 
- "IF UTAH'S
 LIQUOR
 LAWS
 WEREN'T
 SO RESTRICTIVE,
 I'D
 INVITE
 YOU
 OUT
 FOR
 A DRINK,"
 I JOKED,
 BUT
 REMAINED
 SERIOUS. 

MY JOKE
 SEEMED
 TO ANNOY
 HER
 A LITTLE,
 BUT
 SHE
 ORDERED
 ME TO TIGHTEN
 UP ANYWAY
 AND
 WE BOTH
 HEADED
 TO A ROADSIDE
 MOTEL.
 IT SEEMED
 CALM
 AND
 TRUSTWORTHY
 ENOUGH,
 BUT
 I HAD LEARNED
 LONG
 AGO
 NOT
 TO TRUST
 WHAT
 MY EYES SAW. 
NO ONE
 WAS
 FOLLOWING
 US FROM
 ANYWHERE
 ANYMORE,
 BUT TO MAKE
 SURE
 WE WERE
 SAFE
 FOR THE
 NIGHT
 ZONARA
 GOT
 HER
 REVOLVER
 READY.
 IT WAS
 A LOVELY
 SMITH
 & WESSON
 THAT
 WAS
 OF SUCH
 HIGH
 QUALITY
 YOU
 JUST
 WANTED
 TO STROKE
 IT WITH
 YOUR
 HAND.
 YOU
 WANTED
 TO HOLD
 IT,
 TO PRESS
 THE
 HAMMER
 GENTLY
 IN READINE
SS TO REPRODUCE
 THE
 DEADLY
 SHOT. 
ZONARA
 TUCKED
 IT UNDER
 HIS
 PILLOW
 AND
 FELL
 ASLEEP
 LIKE
 A STUMP,
 BUT
 WARNED
 ME TO STAY
 PUT.
 SOMETIME
 DURING
 THE
 NIGHT
 WE SWITCHED. 
WHEN
 DAWN
 BEGAN
 TO BREAK,
 SHE
 TOLD ME QUITE
 SERIOUSLY: 

- NOW
 THE
 TIME
 HAS
 TRULY
 COME
 TO LEARN
 THE
 TRUTH
 THAT
 HAS
 BEEN
 BEFORE
 YOUR
 EYES
 ALL
 ALONG.
 TOO
 65  MANY
 PEOPLE
 HATED
 FELISTER,
 AND
 I WAS
 THE
 TRUE
 REPRESENTATIVE
 OF THE
 DRUG CARTELS,
 ONLY
 I WAS
 WORKING
 IN THE
 SHADOWS
 - I WAS
 FELISTER
'S RIGHT
 HAND
 MAN.
 AND
 YES, MY DEAR,
 I AM FELISTER
'S LEGACY.
 OR AT LEAST
 THAT'S
 HOW
 IT WOULD
 NORMALLY
 BE!
 BUT
 FELISTER
 WAS
 NEVER
 NORMAL! 
FRANKLY,
 I COULD
 ALMOST
 HAVE
 HAD
 A NERVOUS
 TIC.
 I KNEW
 THAT
 THINGS
 WERE
 UNPLEASANT
 TO SAY
 THE
 LEAST,
 BUT
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND
 I WAS
 AWARE
 THAT
 THERE
 WERE
 SOME
 OTHER
 SITUATIONS
 THAT
 ALSO
 HAD TO BE TAKEN
 INTO
 CONSIDERATION.
 ZONARA
 WAS
 ANYTHING
 BUT
 A HYSTERICAL,
 SCHEMING,
 OR EVEN A FRUMP,
 SHE
 WAS
 A VERY
 SERIOUS
 PERSON. 
- "WHAT
 NEXT?,"
 I ASKED
 HER. 
- IF WE JUST
 KEPT
 GOING
 ON HIGHWAY
 SEVENTY
 IT WOULDN'T
 BE A BIG
 PROBLEM,
 ONLY
 THE
RE WAS
 SOMETHING
 IMPORTANT. 
ZONARA
 TOOK
 MY HAND
 AND
 WE SLOWLY
 WALKED
 THROUGH
 SOME
 ENDLESS
 GRASSES
 THAT
 WERE
 BEHIND
 THE
 MOTEL.
 WE WALKED
 FOR A BIT
 AND
 STOPPED.
 THERE
 WAS
 A ROCKY
 AND
 SANDY
 ROAD
 WINDING
 THROUGH
 THERE,
 AND
 THE
 SKY
 ABOVE
 WAS
 SO BEAUTIFUL
 - WITH
 PURPLE
 HUES,
 AND
 THE
 STARS
 - THEY
 WERE
 JUST
 BRILLIANT
 AND
 EACH
 SPARKLED
 WITH
 THEIR
 OWN
 BEAUTY.
 SOON
 MORNING
 WOULD
 HIDE
 THEM
 FROM
 OUR
 EYES, BUT
 I WAS
 MORE
 THAN
 SURE
 THAT
 THE
 ZONAR
 WAS
 NOT
 AT ALL
 EXCITED
 BY ANY
 ROMANTIC
 SIGHTS
 OR OTHER
 WILDNESS.
 APPARENTLY
 HE WASN'T
 PARTICULARLY
 EXCITED
 ABOUT
 MONEY
 EITHER,
 BECAUSE
 HE LEFT
 A TIP
 OF MORE
 THAN
 FIFTY
 DOLLARS,
 WHICH
 WAS
 ENOUGH
 TO EMBARRASS
 HIMSELF
 AND
 NOT
 NEARLY
 ENOUGH
 TO MAKE
 TOO
 MUCH
 OF AN IMPRESSION. 

- "FELISTER
'S REAL
 AIM
 AND LEGACY,
 I THINK,"
 SHE
 BEGAN
 CAUTIOUSLY,
 "WAS
 TO ACHIEVE
 GREAT
 66  HEIGHTS
 IN THE
 MAGICAL
 ART.
 HAVE
 YOU
 HEARD
 OF ABRAMELIN'S
 BOOK
 - "ABRA...
," I STAMMERED,
 "IT SEEMED
 LIKE
 A JOKE,
 BUT MY FACE
 DIDN'T
 FLINCH.'BUT
 WHY
 WAS
 HE DOING
 IT..." 
- "IT IS
 SAID,"
 SHE
 BEGAN
 CONFIDENTIALLY,
 "THAT
 THIS
 BOOK
 CONTAINS
 ONLY
 A SINGLE
 RITUAL,
 WHICH
 IS VERY
 DIFFICULT
 FOR
 THE
 ADEPT
 TO PERFORM,
 BUT
 WHOEVER
 IS PIOUS
 AND
 HUMBLE
 ENOUGH
 CAN
 COME
 INTO
 CONTACT
 WITH
 HIS
 OWN
 GUARDIAN
 ANGEL
 AND
 HE WILL
 GIVE
 HIM
 GREAT
 POWERS." 
- "YOU
 MEAN
 TO SAY
 THAT
 THE
 TRUE
 LEGACY
 OF A FELISTER
 IS PURELY
 AND
 SIMPLY
 A BOOK?,"
 THAT
 FINISHED
 ME OFF
 DEFINITIVELY. 
- I SUPPOSE
 WE MIGHT
 FIND
 OTHER
 VALUABLES,
 BUT
 THAT'S
 NOT
 WHAT
 I SET
 OUT
 FOR.
 FELISTER
 HAD
 A CONSIDERABLE
 FORTUNE,
 AND
 BY MY RECKONING
 HAD SAVED
 AT LEAST
 TOWARDS
 A HUNDRED
 AND FIFTY
 MILLIONS
 OF PURE
 MONEY,
 IF NOT
 MORE.
 BUT LET'S
 FACE
 IT,
 I CAN'T
 DO IT ALONE,
 SO THOSE
 WHO
 DIDN'T
 MAKE
 US A PITA
 ON THE
 HIGHWAY
 FOR A WHILE
 MIGHT
 FIND
 US AND
 THEN
 IT WOULD
 GET
 SCARY.
 DONOVAN
 IS NO FOOL
 EITHER,
 AND
 HE'LL
 GET
 THE
 MESSAGE
 SOONER
 OR LATER
 WHAT
 THE
 WHOLE
 THING
 WAS
 ABOUT
 - THAT
 THE
 OTHER
 GRIMOIRES
 WERE
 LIKE
 CHILD'S
 PLAY
 COMPARED
 TO THIS
 ONE. 
- "SO FELISTER
 WASN'T
 QUITE
 THE
 MERCIFUL
 SAMARITAN
 WE THOUGHT
 HIM
 TO BE AFTER
 ALL,
 AND
 HE WANTED
 IMMENSE
 POWER!,"
 I DIDN'T
 HOLD
 BACK
 THIS
 TIME.
 "BUT
 WHY
 DID
 HE NEED
 ME
 - "I'LL
 TELL
 YOU
 THIS
 TOO,"
 ZONARA
 REASSURED
 ME, "FELISTER
 WAS
 TOO
 OLD ALREADY,
 AND
 THIS
 RITUAL
 NEEDS
 YOUNGER
 BOYS
 WHO
 ARE
 PERFECTLY
 SUITED
 TO COME
 INTO
 CONTACT
 WITH
 THE
 GUARDIAN
 ANGEL.
 THE
 POWERS
 AN ANGEL
 IS CAPABLE
 OF BESTOWING
 67  UPON
 YOU
 REALLY
 GO BEYOND
 CONVENTIONAL
 NOTIONS." 

NOW
 THE
 PICTURE
 IS BEGINNING
 TO CLEAR
 UP FOR ME. I, THE
 MARGINALIZED
 CHILD
 TAKEN
 IN BY MISTER
 EMBANKS,
 WAS
 BEING
 GROOMED
 AS A SACRIFICIAL
 LAMB
 TO SATISFY
 THIS
 PSYCHOPATH'S
 DESIRE
 FOR INEXHAUSTIBLE
 POWER.
 I REALIZED
 THAT
 MY PATHS
 WITH
 ZONARA
 HAD
 NOT
 CROSSED
 BY ACCIDENT
 AND
 THAT
 SHE
 WAS
 JUST
 ANOTHER
 PIECE
 OF THE
 PUZZLE.
 I ALSO
 REALIZED
 THAT
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 HADN'T
 JUST
 WIPED
 OUT
 FELISTER. 
- "I
 WANTED
 TO REMOVE
 HIM,"
 ZONARA
 REVEALED
 HER
 CARDS
 FURTHER,
 "SO
 THAT
 AFTER
 EMBANX'S
 DEATH
 OUR
 PATH
 WOULD
 BE COMPLETELY
 CLEAR
 AND WE COULD
 PERFORM
 THE
 RITUAL
 UNDISTURBED!" 
WE WERE
 WALKING
 THROUGH
 THE
 FIELDS
 OF SOUTHERN
 UTAH,
 FULL
 AND
 DOTTED
 WITH
 BEAUTIFUL,
 BLOOMING
 CACTI,
 AND
 SUDDENLY
 ZONARA
 TURNED
 TO ME, ASKING
 ME HIS
 NEXT
 QUESTION: 
- ARE
 YOU
 READY
 TO DO THIS?
 YOU
 CAN
 HAVE
 IT ALL... 
I UNDERSTOOD
 THAT
 THE
 OTHER
 SIDE
 WAS
 WAITING
 FOR MY FINAL
 ANSWER. 
- "YOU
 KNOW?,"
 I TURNED
 TO HER
 IN TURN,
 THE
 WIND
 RUFFLING
 HER
 HAIR
 AS THE
 LIGHT
 BREEZE,
 AND
 THE
 LIGHT
 BREEZE
 HAD
 RUFFLED
 HER
 HAIR.
 I WALKED
 BACK
 TO AMERICA
 TO BREATHE
 THE
 FRESH
 AIR OF FREEDOM. 
MY WORDS
 SEEMED TO STING
 HER. 
- "I
 DON'T
 UNDERSTAND
 YOU,"
 SHE
 MURMURED
 TIMIDLY,
 TRYING
 TO MAINTAIN
 HER
 PSYCHOLOGICAL
 EDGE. 
- "FELISTER
 HAS
 LONG
 BEEN
 A PART
 OF A PAST
 THAT
 WILL
 NOT
 RETURN.
 OF ANOTHER
 LIFE
 THAT
 WON'T
 REPEAT
 ITSELF,"
 I SPOKE,
 STRIDING
 TOWARDS
 HER. 
68  THE
 SITUATION
 WAS
 RATHER
 STRANGE. 
IT DIDN'T
 MAKE
 MUCH
 IMPRESSION
 ON US THAT
 THERE
 MIGHT
 BE COYOTES
 AROUND
 WHO
 WOULD
 BE HAPPY
 TO HAVE
 UNINVITED
 GUESTS.
 AND
 YES COYOTES
 DEFINITELY
 ATTACKED
 PEOPLE
 WHEN
 THEY
 WERE
 HUNGRY! 

- "YOU
 MEAN...,"
 HER VOICE
 QUIVERED
 AND
 SHE
 LOOKED
 AT ME KIND
 OF FUNNY,
 "THAT
 WOULD
 BE THE
 ONLY
 LIFE
 YOU
 WOULD
 LIVE." 
- "NOT
 QUITE,"
 I INTERRUPTED
 HER,
 "I
 ONLY
 SAID
 THAT
 IT WAS
 FELISTER
 WHO
 STARTED
 THE
 WHOLE
 STORY." 
MY WORDS
 SEEMED
 TO SOBER
 HER.
 SHE
 ONLY
 NERVOUSLY
 TAPPED
 HER
 FINGERS,
 OBVIOUSLY
 AS THOUGHTFUL
 AS I WAS.
 SHE
 WENT
 ON THINKING-THAT
 BRIEF
 MOMENT
 SEEMED
 TO LAST
 AN ETERNITY,
 AND
 I WOULD
 HAVE
 DIED
 FOR IT. FOR THAT
 MOMENT
 I WATCHED
 HER
 EYES, READY
 AND
 COLD
 AS GLASS,
 BUT
 FIXED
 ON INFINITY. 
- "WELL,
 WELL,
 PARTNER,"
 SHE
 MURMURED. 
- "I'LL
 PARTICIPATE,"
 I ENDED
 THE
 SUBJECT. 
 
CHAPTER
 EIGHT:
 DEMONIC
 POWER 
 
DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO MAKE
 A FOOL
 OF HIMSELF
 BY TRYING
 TO GO HEAD
 TO HEAD
 WITH
 EVERYTHING
 HIMSELF.
 TO DEAL
 WITH
 IT,
 HE CALLED
 IN ONE
 OF THE
 MOST
 EXPERIENCED
 DEMONOLOGISTS
 - ESANDNER
 FAWKES. 
THE
 DEMONOLOGIST
 WAS
 A SPECIALIST
 IN ALL
 THESE
 GRIMOIRES
 AND
 WAS
 WILLING
 TO HELP
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 FROM
 THE
 BOTTOM
 OF HIS
 HEART,
 AS HE KNEW
 THE
 69  MATTER
 WAS
 TOO
 SPECIFIC.
 BUT
 SOMEWHERE
 IN THERE
 SOMETHING
 UNFORESEEN
 HAPPENED.
 DETECTI
VE DONOVAN
 SUDDENLY
 DIED.
 HE HAD
 CALLED
 THE
 DEMONOLOGIST
 WHEN
 HE HEARD
 A SLIGHT
 RUSTLING
 AND
 AN INVISIBLE
 HAND
 GRABBED
 HIM
 BY THE
 THROAT.
 HE SQUEEZED
 UNTIL
 HIS
 EYES WERE
 ABOUT
 TO POP
 OUT
 OF THEIR
 ORBITS.
 BUT
 WHEN
 THAT
 BRUTAL,
 INVISIBLE
 HAND
 RELEASED
 ITS
 POWERFUL
 GRIP
 ON HIS
 NECK
 THERE
 WERE
 NO SCARS.
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 HAD
 SIMPLY
 INADVERTENTLY
 ACTIVATED
 ONE
 OF FELISTER
'S PROTECTIVE
 SPELLS,
 THROWING
 THE
 PAPER
 PAGES
 INTO
 THE
 FIREPLACE
 FIRE. 
WHEN
 THE
 DEMONOLOGIST
 ARRIVED
 HE WITNESSED
 A MONSTROUS
 MESS
 THAT
 IN NO FORM
 COULD
 BE SAID
 TO HAVE
 BEEN
 CAPABLE
 OF CLUING
 HIM
 INTO
 WHAT
 EXACTLY
 HAD
 HAPPENED,
 BUT
 ESANDNER
 FAWKES
 WAS
 NOT
 YESTERDAY'S
 MAN
 - HE KNEW
 THAT
 DEMONIC
 CREATURES
 ACTED
 IN A SIMILAR
 FASHION.
 THE
 DEMONOLOGIST
 WAS
 ASTUTE
 ENOUGH
 TO REALIZE
 THAT
 DONOVAN
 WAS
 NOT
 PARTICULARLY
 FAMILIAR
 WITH
 THE
 PRINCIPLES
 OF THE
 AFTERLIFE
 AND
 HAD BROUGHT
 ABOUT
 HIS
 DEMISE
 THROUGH
 IGNORANCE.
 ALL
 THAT
 REMAINED
 WAS
 TO INVESTIGATE
 WHAT
 EXACTLY
 HAD
 ATTACKED
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 AND
 WHY. 
FAWKES
 KNEW
 THAT
 DONOVAN
 WAS
 A SERIOUS
 MAN
 WHO
 WOULDN'T
 JUST
 GO OFF
 AND
 PICK
 A FIGHT
 WITH
 FELISTER
 EMBANKS. 
THE
 FAME
 OF THE
 PORK
 CASTRATOR
 WAS
 SPREADING
 FAR
 AND
 WIDE,
 AND
 THERE
 WERE
 TOO
 MANY
 PEOPLE
 WHO
 WANTED
 HIM
 DEAD.
 HE WAS
 BUYING
 UNION
 INFLUENCE
 IN SURROUNDING
 STATES
 WHERE
 THE
 LOCAL
 POPULATION
 WAS
 SUFFERING
 FROM
 UNEMPLOYMENT.
 AND
 SO THERE
 WAS,
 AND
 IT ONLY
 WORKED
 TO HIS
 ADVANTAGE. 
WHEN
 TALKING
 ABOUT
 UNEMPLOYMENT,
 IT ALSO
 HAD
 TO BE ACKNOWLEDGED
 THAT
 FELISTER
 WAS
 A SUBTLE
 70  MANIPULATOR
 - ESPECIALLY
 WHEN
 IT CAME
 TO SPECIFIC
 LABOR
 DONE
 AT NIGHT.
 THERE
 WERE
 TOO MANY
 WILLI
NG TO BECOME
 PART
 OF HIS
 FRAUDULENT
 SCHEMES.
 OF COURSE,
 FELISTER
 COULDN'T
 ACCEPT
 EVERYONE. 

HE NEEDED
 REAL
 CRIMINAL
 ELEMENTS
 WHO
 HAD
 EXPERIENCE
 BOTH
 ON THE
 STREET
 AND
 ON THE
 BATTLEFIELD.
 AND
 THERE
 WERE
 FEW
 OF THEM.
 HE WANTED
 TO RAISE
 STANDARDS
 ACCORDING
 TO WHAT
 THE
 SITUATION
 DEMANDED. 
FELISTER
 IN HIS
 LIFETIME
 WAS
 EVEN IN THE
 HABIT
 OF TAKING
 OUT
 SOME
 OF THE
 PRISONERS
 ON THE
 PRETEXT
 THAT
 THEY
 WOULD
 DO A CERTAIN
 AMOUNT
 OF WORK
 UNDER
 A RELAXED
 REGIME
 ON HIS
 FARM.
 SO HE SECONDED
 THE
 OVERSEERS
 TOO-THOSE
 VENAL
 AND
 UNSCRUPULOUS
 BASTARDS! 
THE
 PRISON
 AUTHORITIES
 PRETENDED
 NOT
 TO CARE
 - NATURALLY,
 FOR
 A PARTICULARLY
 HEFTY
 BRIBE. 
- WHAT
 A MAN
 THE
 FELISTER
 IS!"
 EXCLAIMED
 ONE
 OF THE
 PRISONERS
 NAMED
 VINCE
 REGINALD,
 WHO
 WAS
 TO WORK
 ON HIS
 FARM,
 "SO HE GIVES
 US A SECOND
 CHANC
E! TO THOSE
 MORE
 FAMILIAR,
 THIS
 WAS
 NOT
 EXACTLY
 SO.
 SOMETIMES
 THE
 BRUTAL
 FELISTER
 HAD
 TO DISTRIBUTE
 ADDITIONAL
 SHIPMENTS
 OF THE
 GOODS
 AROUND
 THE
 STATES,
 AND
 FOR THIS
 REASON
 THE
 MEAT
 OF SOME
 OF THE
 MURDERED
 PRISONERS
 WAS
 BRUTALLY
 INTERFERED
 WITH
 THE
 PORK. 
YES, SOME
 OF FELISTER
'S FARM
 CUSTOMERS
 HAD
 ACTUALLY
 EATEN
 IT AND
 HAD
 EVEN SAID
 THAT
 THEY
 PARTICULARLY
 LIKED
 THE
 COMBINATION
 OF FLAVOUR
 AND
 AROMA
 BETWEEN
 PORK
 AND
 CHICKEN
 AND
 THAT
 THIS
 OWNER
 DEFINITELY
 UNDERSTOOD
 LIVESTOCK
 FARMING.
 STILL,
 FELISTER
 WAS
 CAREF
UL NOT
 TO OVERDO
 IT,
 AND
 ONLY
 THOSE
 THAT
 ACTUALLY
 71  DESERVED
 IT WENT
 INTO
 THE
 MEAT
 GRINDER.
 FOR EXAMPLE,
 ONE
 OF THEM
 WAS
 VINCE
 REGINALD,
 WHO
 HAD
 TRIED
 TO SHRINK
 A KILO
 OF THE
 STUFF
 AND
 RETAIL
 IT ON THE
 STREETS
 OF KANSAS
 CITY
 - AND
 THAT
 WAS
 BEFORE
 THEY
 ADDED
 FENTANYL.
 FELISTER
 INTERPRETED
 IT NOT
 ONLY
 AS POOR
 PROFESSIONAL
 ETHICS,
 BUT
 AS A DISPLAY
 OF VERY,
 VERY
 BAD
 TASTE
 IN GENERAL!
 THIS
 INGRATE
 WAS
 BEATEN
 WITH
 METAL
 PIPES
 AND
 BRUTALLY
 CASTRATED,
 AND
 LATER
 SKINNED
 ALIVE
 AND
 MINCED,
 ALONG
 WITH
 THE
 FLESH
 OF SOME
 OF
 THE
 BOARS
 THAT
 HAD
 BEEN
 EATEN.
  AT SOME
 TIME,
 FELISTER
 DECIDED
 IT WAS
 FAR
 MORE
 INTERESTING
 TO TAKE
 ADVANTAGE
 OF SOME
 TAX
 BREAKS
 FOR HIS
 PERVERTED
 BUSINESS.
 TAX
 LAW
 IN THE
 STATES
 WAS
 FAR
 TOO
 COMPLEX,
 AND
 ONE
 COULDN'T
 JUST
 FIDDLE
 WITH
 IT - ONE
 HAD
 TO HIRE
 A TAX
 SPECIALIST,
 AND
 ALSO
 A SEPARATE
 ACCOUNTANT
 TO HANDLE
 JUST
 THAT
 PART
 OF RUNNING
 THE
 FINANCIAL
 OPERATIONS
 - OF COURSE,
 THIS
 APPLIED
 TO SOME
 OF THE
 LARGER
 ENTERPRISES,
 AS FELISTER
'S WAS
 IN PRACTICE.
 BETWEEN,
 BY THE
 WAY,
 MR.
 EMBANKS
 TRUSTED
 ONE
 OF THE
 EX-CONVICTS,
 WHO
 HAD
 STEPPED
 INTO
 THE
 ROLE
 OF THE
 REAL
 ACCOUNTANT,
 AND
 FELISTER
 HAD
 HIRED
 AS A FRONT
 SOME
 GRANDMOTHER
 FROM
 SOME
 VERY
 BACKWOODS
 TOWN-
A LONG
 WAY
 FROM
 KANSAS
 CITY.
 HIS
 FARM'S
 REGISTRATION
 ITSELF
 WAS
 AS A STOCK
 CORPORATION,
 WHICH
 IN EFFECT
 HAD
 TO PAY
 QUALIFIED
 DIVIDENDS
 TO ITS
 FELLOW
 STOCKHOLDERS,
 AND
 THEY
 FELL
 INTO
 THE
 LOWER
 TAX
 BRACKET
 AND
 COULD
 OFTEN
 GET
 EVEN A ZERO
 TAX
 RATE.
 BUT
 HERE
 AGAIN,
 FELISTER
 HAD FOUND
 A LOOPHOLE.
 THE
 LISTED
 CO-SHAREHOLDERS
 WERE
 EFFECTIVELY
 HIS
 FORMER
 WORKERS
 WHO
 HAD
 EXTENSIVE
 CRIMINAL
 RECORDS
 AND
 HE WAS
 VISITING
 THEM
 TO POCKET
 SOME
 OF THE
 PROFITS
 - HOW
 DID
 THAT
 WORK?
 WELL,
 THE
 CASTRATOR
 WAS
 WORKING
 MAINLY
 WITH
 PRISONERS
 UNDER
 HOUSE
 ARREST
 WHILE
 ON PROBATION
 AND
 TRANSFERRING
 SUPPOSEDLY
 72  INHERITED
 SHARES
 OF HIS
 ENTERPRISE
 FROM
 THE
 FORMER
 "BALLERS"
 WHO
 HAD
 FALLEN
 FOR
 HIS
 BAIT.
 AND
 SO THE
 CAROUSEL
 WAS
 ENDLESS.
 THIS
 WAY
 BOTH
 SIDES
 BENEFITED
 - NO ONE
 WAS
 HARMED,
 BECAUSE
 USUALLY
 THE
 PRISONERS
 COULDN'T
 GET
 A NORMAL
 JOB,
 AND
 USUALLY
 THEY
 COULDN'T
 COMMIT
 CRIMES,
 AND
 THE
 FENCE'S
 DECENT
 DIVIDENDS
 COULD
 BRING
 THEM
 FIVE
 THOUSAND
 DOLLARS
 A MONTH
 WITHOUT
 DOING
 ANYTHING
 FOR
 THEM! 
TO AVOID
 UNNECESSARY
 BLATANCY,
 FELISTER
 MADE
 THE
 LAWYERS
 WHO
 HANDLED
 THEIR
 CASES
 PROVIDE
 THEM
 WITH
 SPECIAL
 POWERS
 OF ATTORNEY,
 WHICH
 THEY
 SIGNED
 WILLINGLY
 TO PARTICIPATE
 IN THE
 CRIMINAL
 SCHEME.
 OF COURSE,
 THEY
 ALSO
 RECEIVED
 A FAT
 FEE,
 WHICH
 WAS
 ONLY
 THE
 BEGINNING
 OF A LONG
 SERIES
 OF FRUITFUL
 COOPERATION. 
IN BETWEEN,
 THE
 TAXMEN
 WERE
 SNIFFING
 AROUND
 ALL
 OF THEM
 FOR A LONG
 TIME,
 BUT
 FELISTER
 MANAGED
 TO GAG
 THEM! 
FELISTER
 MANAGED
 TO SAVE
 BETWEEN
 A MILLION
 AND
 A HALF
 A MONTH
 OUTSIDE
 THE
 OFFICIAL
 ARRANGEMENT
 WITH
 THE
 CARTELS,
 WHICH
 USUALLY
 PROVIDED
 HIM
 WITH
 ABOUT
 THREE
 OR FOUR
 MILLION.
 SOON
 HE SAW
 HIMSELF
 WITH
 TOO
 MUCH
 FRESH
 FINANCIAL
 RESOURCE,
 AND
 BEGAN
 TO CONSTRUCT
 A PLAN HOW
 TO GET
 HOLD
 OF THE
 MYTHICAL
 GRIMOIRE
 ON THE
 TRAIL
 OF WHICH
 ZONARA
 AND
 I HAD
 SET OUT. 
THE
 BOOK
 SCARED
 HIM
 WITH
 THE
 POSSIBILITIES
 OF POWER
 IT COULD
 PROVIDE.
 HE CRAVED
 TO BE INFLUENTIAL
 AND
 SIGNIFICANT.
 HE COULD
 EVEN
 SCREW
 THE
 MEXICANS
 THEMSELVES,
 USING
 HIS
 KNOWLEDGE
 OF NECROMANCY
 GRANTED
 TO HIM
 BY THE
 HIGHER
 POWERS. 

BY THE
 WAY,
 THE
 KNOWLEDGE
 OF NECROMANCY
 WAS
 NECESSARY
 TO FELISTER
 FOR ANOTHER
 REASON,
 73  NAMELY
 TO SUCCEED
 IN HIS
 CHERISHED
 GOAL.
 NECROMANCY,
 WAS
 A MAGIC
 ASSOCIATED
 WITH
 THE
 WORLD
 OF THE
 DEAD,
 AND
 FELISTER
 KNEW
 THAT
 THE
 ENERGY
 OF DEATH
 WAS
 NEITHER
 GOOD
 NOR
 EVIL!
 THE
 INTERESTING
 THING
 WAS
 THAT
 AT THE
 MOMENT
 OF DEATH,
 SUCH
 A LARGE
 AMOUNT
 OF NEGATIVE
 ENERGY
 COULD
 BE RELEASED
 THAT
 COULD
 KILL
 DOZENS
 AND
 DOZENS
 OF PEOPLE.
 THAT
 WAS
 WHY
 HE HAD
 TO HANDLE
 DANGEROUS
 KNOWLEDGE
 WITH AN INCREASED
 AMOUNT
 OF CAUTION,
 AS IT COULD
 CAUSE
 SOME
 UNPREDICTABLE
 CONSEQUENCES. 
THIS
 TIME
 HE HOPED
 TO GET
 HOLD
 OF THE
 ABRAMELIN
 GRIMOIRE,
 WHICH,
 BY THE
 WAY,
 WAS
 ALSO
 USED
 AT ONE
 TIME
 BY THE
 FAMOUS
 ALISTER
 CROWLEY
2. 
FELISTER
 LONGED
 TO BE ABLE
 TO ACCOMPLISH
 SOMETHING
 THAT
 NO ONE
 BEFORE
 HIM
 HAD
 DONE
 IN RECENT
 TIMES
 - TO BE ABLE
 TO CONTROL
 THIS
 ENERGY
 OF DEATH,
 BUT
 THERE
 WAS
 A CATCH
 - HE HAD
 TO LEARN
 TO LIVE
 WITH
 IT. 
FELISTER
 HAD
 OBTAINED
 THE
 GRIMOIRE
 AFTER
 A VERY
 LONG
 SEARCH,
 AND FRANKLY
 HE HADN'T
 BEEN
 PARTICULARLY
 ENTHRALLED
 WHEN
 IT FIRST
 FELL
 INTO
 HIS
 HANDS. 
FOR SUCH
 A HEFTY
 SUM
 HE HAD
 EXPECTED
 MORE,
 BUT
 LATER
 HIS
 OPINION
 CHANGED
 CONSIDERABLY.
 THE
 GRIMOIRE
 COULD
 HAVE
 OPENED
 THE
 DOORS
 TO KABBALAH,
 THAT
 ANCIENT
 TEACHING
 AROUND
 WHICH
 THERE
 WAS
 SO MUCH
 MYSTERY,
 BUT
 IT COULD
 ALSO
 HAVE
 POINTED
 HIM
 IN THE
 RIGHT
 DIRECTION
 TOWARDS
 TRUE
 MAGIC,
 WHICH
 COULD
 TRULY
 GIVE
 HIM
 LIMITLESS
 POSSIBILITIES. 
                                               
 2 Alistair Crowley - famous English occultist and Kabbalist
, 
ceremonial magician. 
74  FELISTER
 ALSO
 HAD
 YOUNG
 BOYS
 ON HIS
 TEAM
 - SOME
 OF THEM
 WERE
 REALLY
 TOO
 YOUNG,
 SO MUCH
 SO THAT
 THEY
 HAD
 HARDLY
 LIVED.
 THAT
 BEAUTIFUL
 SENSE
 OF "BLUE
 SPRING"
 THAT
 THEY
 WERE
 DESPERATELY
 SEEKING
 BUT
 WAS
 REALLY
 THE
 ROAD
 TO NOWHERE.
 FELISTER
 CALLED
 THEM
 THE
 LOST
 GENERATION
 - A YOUNG,
 IMPETUOUS
 GENERATION
 THAT
 WANTED
 TO DO SOMETHING
 WITH
 THEIR
 LIVES
 BUT
 DIDN'T
 KNOW
 WHAT,
 AND
 MR.
 EMBANKS
 WAS
 GIVING
 THEM
 A CHANCE
 TO GET
 INTO
 THE
 BIG
 GAME
 - AT LEAST
 FOR A LITTLE
 WHILE,
 OR MORE
 ACCURATELY
 TO THINK
 THEY
 DID.
 THEY
 NEEDED
 HIM
 TO FIND
 THE
 PERFECT
 ADEPT
 TO PERFORM
 THE
 RITUAL,
 AND
 THAT
 TOOK
 TIME.
 AND
 FELISTER
 HAD TOO MUCH
 TO DEAL
 WITH. 
FELYSTER
 CRAVED
 DEATH,
 BUT
 HE WANTED
 TO GET
 ALL
 HIS
 AFFAIRS
 IN ORDER
 BEFORE
 THAT,
 AND
 THEY
 WERE
 NOT
 FEW.
 HOW
 MANY
 TIMES
 HAD
 HE TRIED
 TO REALIZE
 HIS
 OWN
 CURSE
 WAS
 SLOWLY
 PUSHING
 HIM
 TO THE
 EDGE
 OF THE
 ABYSS? 
AND
 WHAT
 CAME
 NEXT?
 TO GAIN
 UNLIMITED
 KNOWLEDGE
 OF THE
 WORLD,
 OR OF THE
 NETHERWORLD
 ITSELF?
 OF THOSE
 BOUNDS
 WHERE
 NO MAN
 COULD
 TREAD! 
FOR THE
 INITIATION,
 FELISTER
 FOUND
 A TRUE
 PRACTITIONER
 OF MAGIC
 WHOM
 HE HAD
 BROUGHT
 HOME
 FROM
 ALMOST
 THE
 OTHER
 SIDE
 OF THE
 WORLD-
ALL
 THE
 WAY
 FROM
 EGYP
T. ACCORDING
 TO THE
 INSTRUCTIONS,
 THEY
 WERE
 TO DO THE
 INITIATION
 OF FELISTER
 HIMSELF
 IN THE
 GRAVEYARDS,
 AND THEY
 WEREN'T
 THAT
 FAR
 AWAY.
 BUT BEFORE
 THEY
 STARTED
 THERE,
 THE
 MAGICIAN
 TOLD
 HIM: 
- "IF THE
 SO-CALLED
 "WORDS
 OF POWER,"
 PUT
 INTO
 THE
 DEAD
 MAN'S
 MOUTH
 ARE
 USED,
 EVEN THE
 GODS
 THEMSELVES
 WILL
 OBEY
 HIM! 
75  - "THEN
 MAKE
 ALL
 MY MALEFACTORS
 GO AWAY,"
 LAUGHED
 FELISTER
 WITH
 HIS
 IMPISH
 GRIN.
 HE WAS
 JUST
 A LOOSE
 PSYCHOPATH! 
EVEN THE
 EGYPTIAN
 MAGE
 WAS
 SLIGHTLY
 TAKEN
 ABACK
 - NOT
 BECAUSE
 HIS
 WORDS
 WERE
 UNUSUAL,
 BUT BECAUSE
 OF THE
 CASUALNESS
 OF THE
 MAN
 WHO
 HAD
 SPOKEN
 THEM. 
ON A RAINY
 MORNING,
 FELISTER
 SIMPLY
 WALKED
 WITH
 THE
 EGYPTIAN
 IN THE
 AGREED
 DIRECTION,
 AS THE
 LOCATION
 WAS
 OF GREAT
 IMPORTANCE
 FOR PERFORMING
 THE
 RITUAL: 
- "AND
 REMEMBER
 THAT
 THE
 NECROMANCER
 LIVES
 HALF HIS
 LIFE,
 AND
 WILL
 DIE
 AS HE WAS
 MEANT
 TO DIE,"
 RATHER
 STRANGELY
 ANSWERED
 THE 
FELISTER
 NEEDED
 AN INTERPRETER
 TO UNDERSTAND
 HIS
 CONFUSED
 RAMBLINGS.
 BUT
 STILL
 HE MANAGED
 TO KEEP
 UP AND
 GRASP
 HIS
 INTERLOCUTOR'S
 MEANING.
 HAVING
 BEEN
 INITIATED,
 HE FINALLY
 UNDERSTOOD
 THAT
 HE HAD
 TO PERFORM
 THE
 SECOND
 PART
 OF HIS
 JOB
 OF INITIATING
 THE
 ADEPT
 AS WELL. 
SOON
 THE
 CEREMONY
 COULD
 BEGIN
 AND
 HE MADE
 THE
 BOY
 FOLLOW
 THE
 RITUAL
 - IT TOOK HIM
 A FULL
 EIGHTEEN
 MONTHS
 AND
 A HUGE
 AMOUNT
 OF DISCIPLINE. 

IT WAS
 ME HE HAD
 CHOSEN,
 BUT ACCORDING
 TO THE
 REQUIREMENTS,
 I WAS
 NOT
 PURE
 ENOUGH
 - AFTER
 ALL,
 I HAD
 KILLED
 INNOCENT
 ANIMALS! 
THIS
 HAD
 PUZZLED
 FELISTER,
 BUT
 HE HAD
 NOT
 REVEALED
 HIS
 DESIGN
 TO ME,
 ONLY
 THAT
 HE INTENDED
 TO MAKE
 ME THE
 ADEPT
 WHO
 WOULD
 SUCCEED
 HIM. 
HE HAD
 QUITE
 OFTEN
 TAKEN
 ME TO THE
 CEMETERIES,
 WHERE
 HE TOLD ME 76  - IF YOU
 TREAT
 THE
 DEAD
 WITH
 RESPECT,
 THEY
 WILL
 BE YOUR
 FRIENDS
 ALONG
 THE
 WAY.
 THEY
 WILL
 WANT
 TO HELP
 YOU
 FOR HAVING
 TREATED
 THEM
 WITH DUE RESPECT
 AND
 THUS
 ALLEVIATED
 THEIR
 SUFFERING
 IN THE
 AFTERLIFE. 
SO MY DUTIES
 INCLUDED
 THE
 MAINTENANCE
 OF MANY
 OF THEM.
 FELISTER
'S CEMETERY
 WAS
 PRIVATE,
 MAINLY
 BECAUSE
 OF LEGAL
 RESTRICTIONS
 THAT
 PREVENTED
 OUTSIDE
 OBSERVERS
 FROM
 SEEING
 EXACTLY
 WHAT
 WAS
 GOING
 ON IN IT. 
IN TIME,
 FELISTER
 BECAME
 CONVINCED
 THAT
 THE
 USE
 OF SERIOUS
 SECURITY
 WAS
 NOT
 AT ALL
 UNNECESSARY
 BECAUSE
 THERE
 WERE
 SEVERAL
 SERIOUS
 CASES
 OF ROBBED
 GRAVES! 
AFTER
 A WHILE,
 HE PICKED
 UP ON ANOTHER
 BOY
 WHO
 WAS
 A NEWCOMER
 AND
 WAS
 THE
 ONLY
 ONE
 WITHOUT
 A CRIMINAL
 RECORD
 - HE HAD
 ALSO
 BEEN
 PICKED
 UP FROM
 SOME
 ORPHANAGE! 
BUT HE DIDN'T
 HAVE
 MY QUALITIES
 - LIKE
 UNSCRUPULOUSNESS
 AND
 INTELLIGENCE! 
SOME
 OF THE
 INMATES
 RESENTED
 SEEING
 WHAT
 HAD HAPPENED
 TO THEIR
 COMRADES,
 AND
 ALL
 THIS
 WAS
 HAPPENING
 AT A TIME
 WHEN
 THE
 TAXMEN
 WERE
 ALSO
 BEGINNING
 TO TIGHTEN
 THE
 CIRCLE
 AROUND
 FELISTER.
 AND
 A LITTLE
 LATER
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 APPEARED
 AND
 ENDED
 HIS
 LIFE THROUGH
 HIS
 WELL
 ORGANIZED
 OPERATION. 

 
CHAPTER
 NINE:
 DEADLY
 PURSUIT 
 
THE
 TWO
 OF US WITH
 ZONARA
 WERE
 TO CONTINUE
 OUR
 WANDERINGS,
 AND
 CROSSING
 THE
 DESERT
 FIELDS
 OF 77  UTAH
 WAS
 ONLY
 THE
 BEGINNING.
 THERE
 WAS
 STILL
 NO ONE
 AFTER
 US. 
- "IT'S
 STRANGE
 REALLY,"
 THE
 GIRL
 TURNED
 TO ME, "BUT
 PERHAPS
 ..." 
SHE
 SEEMED TO CATCH
 HERSELF
 BY THE
 HEART. 
- "APPARENTLY
 SOMEONE
 HAS
 DIED,"
 SHE
 SAID
 WITH
 HIDDEN
 SORROW.
 "IT'S
 SO SAD,
 AND
 I EXPECTED
 TO MEET
 OTHER
 PEOPLE
 AT THE
 END.
 'THE
 ROAD
 IS DARK
 AND
 NOT
 FOR
 EVERYONE,"
 SHE
 FINISHED
 AMBIGUOUSLY. 

WE CONTINUED
 ALONG
 THE
 GRITTY
 PATH,
 WHICH
 WAS
 LOST
 IN INFINITY. 
I HAD
 THE
 STRANGEST
 FEELING
 THAT
 SOMETHING
 ABOUT
 THIS
 GIRL
 WAS
 NOT
 RIGHT
 AT ALL.
 BUT
 THE
 MORE
 TIME
 PASSED,
 THE
 MORE
 I BECAME
 CONVINCED
 THAT
 THE
 SITUATION
 REALLY
 COULD
 SPIRAL
 OUT
 OF CONTROL.
 SOMETHING
 ABOUT
 THE
 WHOLE
 STORY
 SO FAR
 DIDN'T
 ADD
 UP AT ALL. 
IF SHE
 HAD
 ACTUALLY
 KILLED,
 OR HAD
 ORDERED
 THE
 MURDER
 OF,
 FELISTER
 HIMSELF,
 THEN
 WHAT
 WAS
 THE
 MISSING
 PIECE
 IN THE
 PUZZLE?
 WHAT EXACTLY
 WAS
 ESCAPING
 MY OWN
 AND
 I CLAIM
 DISCERNING
 GAZE? 
THAT
 QUESTION
 REALLY
 DESERVED
 SOME
 ANSWER! 
AFTER
 MUCH
 CONTEMPLATION,
 I BEGAN
 TO REALIZE
 THAT
 THE
 SITUATION
 WAS
 PERHAPS
 EVEN MORE
 BIZARRE
 THAN
 I HAD
 ACTUALLY
 IMAGINED
 IT - ZONARA
 WAS
 THE
 TRUE
 CLAIMANT
 TO THE
 FELISTER
'S LEGACY
 - SHE
 WANTED
 TO MASTER
 HIS
 SECRET
 KNOWLEDGE,
 AND
 I WAS
 TO BE SACRIFICED
 ONCE AGAIN.
 BUT I WASN'T
 GOING
 TO GIVE
 HER
 THAT
 OPPORTUNITY! 
I TRIED
 TO KEEP
 MY FACE
 FROM
 SHOWING
 IN ANY
 WAY
 EXACTLY
 WHAT
 I INTENDED
 TO DO,
 AS THAT
 WOULD
 78  ONLY
 GIVE
 ME AWAY
 AND CREATE
 UNNECESSARY
 TENSION
 IN OUR
 ALREADY
 STRAINED
 RELATIONSHIP. 
ZONARA
 WALKED
 CONFIDENTLY,
 BUT
 THE
 DISTANCE
 BETWEEN
 US WAS
 NOT
 TOO GREAT.
 MAYBE
 JUST
 A FEW
 STEPS.
 THE
 BEAUTIFUL
 LANDSCAPES
 ALL
 AROUND
 HAD BECOME
 EVEN
 MORE
 NOSTALGIC.
 IT WAS
 ANOTHER
 TIME! 

HOWEVER,
 WE HAD
 YET TO BUILD
 A MORE
 SERIOUS
 PLAN
 OF ACTION,
 AS IN THE
 FUTURE
 THE
 SUDDEN
 QUEUE
 THAT
 HAD
 CAUGHT
 US ON HIGHWAY
 SEVENTY
 ON OUR
 WAY
 TO ... 
WHERE
 WERE
 WE ACTUALLY
 HEADED?
 THE
 TWO
 STATES
 BETWEEN
 MISSOURI
 AND
 OHIO
 WERE
 TOO GENERAL
 A CONCEPT
 - THERE
 WAS
 SOMETHING
 ELSE
 HERE. 

PERHAPS
 THE
 OLD
 FELISTER
'S NON-ACCEPTANCE
 OF ME AS A FULL
-FLEDGED
 ADEPT
 HAD
 ALSO
 MADE
 HER
 FEEL
 MORE
 SPECIAL
 ABOUT
 MY HUMBLE
 PERSONA,
 BUT THEN
 I REALIZED
 I COULD
 OUTWIT
 HER
 - JUST
 AS I HAD
 DONE
 WITH
 THE
 OLD FELISTER
 AND
 HE HAD
 TAKEN
 ME UNDER
 HIS
 WING. 
DURING
 MY SPARE
 TIME
 AT FELISTER
'S FARM
 I COULD
 READ.
 VERY
 RARELY
 DID
 I HAVE
 SUCH
 AN OPPORTUNITY,
 BUT I HAD
 IT ANYWAY,
 AND
 THAT
 MADE
 ME HAPPY
 ENOUGH
 - FROM
 ONE
 OF THE
 MANY
 BOOKS
 I HAD
 LEARNED
 THE
 TECHNIQUE
 THAT
 IF YOU
 CLEARED
 YOUR
 MIND
 OF ALL
 THOUGHTS,
 YOUR
 ENERGY
 FIELD
 WOULDN'T
 BE SENSED
 BY OTHERS
 AND
 THEY
 SIMPLY
 WOULDN'T
 NOTICE
 YOU.
 BUT,
 ALAS,
 ZONARA
 WAS
 A PRETTY
 BONY
 NUT! 
ACCOMPANYING
 HER,
 I GOT THE
 IMPRESSION
 THAT
 THE
 HIGHWAY
 CHASE
 HADN'T
 SURPRISED
 HER
 ALL
 THAT
 MUCH
 - APPARENTLY
 FAR
 SCARIER
 AND
 MORE
 DANGEROUS
 THINGS
 WERE
 ABOUT
 TO HAPPEN.
 THINGS
 79  THAT
 WERE
 OUT
 OF THE
 ORDINARY
 FIELD
 OF NORMAL
 EXPLANATIONS. 

THE
 SANDY
 ROAD
 CONTINUED
 AND
 ENDED
 WITH
 AN OLD CABIN
 AND SHEER
 REDDISH
 CLIFFS.
 FROM
 WHAT
 MY EYES COULD
 SEE WE EITHER
 HAD
 TO CLIMB
 UP OR CHOOSE
 THE
 HUT
 FOR
 THE
 NIGHT. 
ZONARA
 HAD
 GONE
 SILENT,
 AND
 APPARENTLY
 MY RATHER
 CRAFTY
 STRATEGY
 WAS
 PAYING
 OFF. 
OF COURSE
 IN MY MIND
 WERE
 ALSO
 THE
 WORDS
 OF THE
 OLD FELISTER: 
- IF YOU
 TREAT
 THE
 DEAD
 WITH
 RESPECT,
 THEY
 WILL
 BE YOUR
 FRIENDS
 ON THE
 ROAD. 
THE
 WHOLE
 PRE-LONG
 SCENE
 WE'D
 SEEN
 THANKS
 TO ZONARA
 HERSELF
 GAVE
 ME SOME
 ADVANTAGES,
 BUT I DIDN'T
 WANT
 HER
 TO GET
 THE
 IMPRESSION
 THAT
 I WAS
 GOING
 TO UNDERTAKE
 A CAREFUL
 ANALYSIS
 OF HER
 QUICKLY
 SPOKEN
 WORDS
 IN THE
 SHORT
 SPACE
 OF JUST
 A FEW
 SECONDS. 
BEFORE
 ENTERING
 THE
 HUT,
 SHE
 HESITATED. 
- "WE MUST
 TREAT
 EVERY
 THING
 IN THIS
 LIFE
 WITH
 A CERTAIN
 RESPECT
 - AS IF IT WERE
 A RITUAL,"
 SHE
 TOLD
 ME GRAVELY,
 "OR THE
 LEGACY
 OF FELISTER
 WILL
 NEVER
 BE OURS." 
THE
 HUT
 WAS
 EMPTY,
 AND
 FRANKLY
 I DIDN'T
 LIKE
 IT.
 I WONDERED
 WHY
 ZONARA
 CHOSE
 THIS
 BACKWATER.
 IF THOSE
 GUYS
 WANTED
 TO STOP
 US,
 WE HAD
 NOWHERE
 TO RUN, AND
 WE HAD
 TO FIGHT. 
ANYWAY
 WE SPENT
 THE
 NIGHT
 AND
 THEN
 I FELT
 THE
 STRANGE
 RADIATION
 OF ZONARA. 
FOR THE
 FIRST
 TIME,
 HER
 PECULIAR
 AURA
 REACHED
 MY SENSES
 - SHE
 HAD
 A SLIGHT
 SMELL
 OF INCENSE
 AND
 HER
 EYES WERE
 CLOSED
 AS SHE
 SLEPT
 SWEETLY.
 BUT
 80  HER
 BODY
 LOOKED
 FUNNY
 LITTLE
 UNDER
 THE
 COVERS
 - AS IF THERE
 WAS
 ABSOLUTELY
 NO ONE
 THERE! 
"MAYBE
 ZONARA
 IS A LIVING
 DEAD!",
 I SAID
 TO MYSELF
 IN MY MIND,
 BUT
 SOME
 PARTICULAR
 "SCRAPING"
 ON MY CONSCIOUSNESS
 MADE
 ME SUSPEND
 ANY
 FURTHER
 ANALYTICAL
 ACTIVITY
 AND
 JUST
 LET
 THE
 DREAM
 OVERTURN
 ME. 
THIS
 TIME
 I HAD
 NO NIGHTMARES
 AND
 IN THE
 MORNING
 WHEN
 I WOKE
 UP IT WAS
 GONE
 - I TOOK A QUICK
 TOUR
 AROUND
 THE
 HUT.
 SHE
 HAD
 DEFINITELY
 GOTTEN
 OUT
 OF THERE
 BEFORE
 ME! THE
 HUT
 ONLY
 HAD
 ONE
 LARGE
 ROOM
 WITH
 A SMALL
 KITCHENETTE
 WHICH
 WAS
 QUITE
 MODEST. 

BUT WHEN
 I WENT
 OUTSIDE,
 SHE
 WAS
 WAITING
 FOR
 ME: - "COME
 ON,
 WHERE
 ARE
 YOU
 GOING.
 FELISTER
 IS THE
 ONE
 WE HAVE
 TO FIND,
 OR RATHER
 HIS
 LEGACY,
 REMEMBER?
 I FELT
 YOU
 WERE
 TRYING
 TO TINKER
 AROUND
 IN MY MIND
 DURING
 THE
 NIGHT,
 WHICH
 FRANKLY
 I KIND
 OF DIDN
'T LIKE,
 BUT
 THAT'S
 ABSOLUTELY
 NO PROBLEM,"
 SHE
 SAID
 CALMLY,
 "IT'S
 PERFECTLY
 NATURAL
 TO HAVE
 SOME
 DOUBTS,
 AND
 IN GENERAL
 I HAVEN'T
 TOLD
 YOU
 ALL
 MY SECRETS
 YET,
 AND
 MAYBE
 I NEVER
 WILL,
 BUT
 YOU'RE
 VERY
 SPECIAL
 AND
 THAT'S
 WHY
 YOU'RE
 STILL
 WITH
 ME.
 WE HAVE
 YET
 TO LOCATE
 THE
 EXACT
 SPOT
 WHERE
 FELISTER
 WANTED
 TO PERFORM
 HIS
 RITUAL." 
- "I
 THOUGHT
 IT WAS
 IN THE
 GRAVEYARD,"
 I LOOKED
 AT HER,
 SOMEWHAT
 STRANGELY,
 "AND,
 NOW
 I REALISE
 IT'S
 QUITE,
 QUITE
 DIFFERENT..." 
- "ACTUALLY,
 FELISTER
'S REAL
 GOAL
 WAS
 TO GET
 OUT
 OF THAT
 CURSED
 PLACE,"
 SHE
 STARTED
 TO EXPLAIN
 TO ME, "IF
 HE GOT
 OUT,
 IT COULD
 ONLY
 MEAN
 ONE
 THING,
 HE HAD
 A CHANCE
 TO BEG
 SALVATION
 FOR
 HIMSELF! 
81  I COULD
 BELIEVE
 HER
 NOW.
 BUT
 WHY
 DID
 THEY
 WANT
 TO SACRIFICE
 ME! WHAT
 WOULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 THEIR
 GAIN? 
ZONARA
 WAS
 ALSO
 CARRYING
 A BAG
 FULL
 OF MONEY,
 AS MANY
 OF THE
 ROADSIDE
 MOTELS
 DIDN'T
 ACCEPT
 CREDIT
 CARDS
 OR ANY
 OTHER
 TYPE
 OF CASHLESS
 PAYMENT. 

AT ONE
 TIME,
 IT EVEN CROSSED
 MY MIND
 TO COLLECT
 THE
 MONEY
 AND
 TAKE
 MY TURN
 WALKING
 AWAY.
 I WAS
 GOING
 TO LIVE
 OUT
 MY OWN
 LIFE
 WITH
 ALL
 THAT
 MONEY
 THAT
 THE
 GREY
 CARDINAL
 OF FELISTER
 HAD
 DIVERTED
 TO HIMSELF,
 BUT
 THEN
 I CHANGED
 MY MIND.
 FIRST,
 SHE
 CARRIED
 A HUGE
 GUN,
 AND
 SECOND,
 FELISTER
 HAD ALWAYS
 KEPT
 HIS
 WORD.
 HE ALWAYS
 MADE
 SURE
 THAT
 HIS
 ACTIONS
 WERE
 FULL
 OF MEANING
 AND
 HE DIDN'T
 LIKE
 TRAITORS,
 AND
 SOMETHING
 TOLD
 ME THAT
 WE WERE
 VERY
 CLOSE
 TO UNCOVERING
 HIS
 FATEFUL
 SECRET,
 AND
 FRANKLY
 THAT
 FLATTERED
 ME! WE WERE
 IN FOR THE
 GREATEST
 ADVENTURE
 ANYONE
 COULD
 GET
 INTO! 
ZONARA
 SEEMED TO SOFTEN
 HER
 TONE
 TOWARDS
 ME, BUT I COULD
 STILL
 SENSE
 HINTS
 OF
 SUPERIORITY. 
- WE HAVE
 NO TIME
 TO LOSE.
 COME! 
AND
 BEGAN
 TO CLIMB
 UP THE
 ROCKS.
 TIME
 PASSED
 SLOWLY
 AS WE DIDN'T
 HAVE
 THE
 NECESSARY
 EQUIPMENT,
 ONLY
 A PAIR
 OF GLOVES
 AND
 A ROPE.
 WE DIDN'T
 HAVE
 ANY
 BELAY
 GEAR
 OR EXTRA
 BELAY
 ROPES. 

- "EVEN IF THEY
 HAD
 TRACKED
 US TO THE
 MOTEL
 AND
 REACHED
 THE
 HUT,
 THEY
 WOULD
 HARDLY
 ADMIT
 THAT
 WE WERE
 CAPABLE
 OF CLIMBING
 THESE
 ROCKS,"
 SHE
 TOLD
 ME IN A SUFFICIENTLY
 CONFIDENT
 TONE. 
I WAS
 NOT
 SURE
 THAT
 HER
 ARGUMENTS
 WERE
 VERY
 CORRECT,
 BUT
 I DID
 NOT
 WISH
 TO ARGUE. 
82  THE
 CLIFFS
 WERE
 SO SHEER
 YOU
 COULD
 HAVE
 FELT
 DIZZY.
 FEAR
 OF HEIGHTS
 WAS
 NOT
 THE
 MOST
 CHARACTERISTIC
 THING
 FOR
 ME. BUT
 WE COULD
 STILL
 PISS
 OUR
 BONES
 - EVEN
 IF WE MADE
 ONE
 WRONG
 MOVE. 
WE WERE
 FINALLY
 AT THE
 TOP
 OF THE
 CLIFF
 AND
 ZONARA
 TURNED
 TO ME: - "THIS
 IS WHERE
 THE
 HARD
 PART STARTS!,"
 SHE
 LAUGHED,
 BUT I THOUGHT
 HER
 SMILE
 WAS
 A BIT
 EXAGGERATED. 

THE
 FURTHER
 WE PROGRESSED
 ALONG
 THE
 PATH,
 I WAS
 CAPTIVATED
 BY THE
 ZONAR'S
 MAGIC.
 THERE
 WAS
 SOMETHING
 AND
 SOME
 REMNANTS
 OF A HIDDEN
 SADNESS
 ABOUT
 HER
 - SO OVERWHELMING
 AS TO BE INDESCRIBABLE. 

I COULD
 CLEARLY
 SENSE
 THAT
 SHE
 DIDN'T
 WANT
 US TO MOVE
 ALONG
 THE
 MAIN
 THOROUGHFARES
 WHERE
 WE COULD
 EASILY
 BE SPOTTED. 
I DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO BOTHER
 HER
 EITHER.
 SO FRAGILE,
 AND
 WITH
 SUCH
 A FIGHTING
 SPIRIT
 WAS
 ZONARA.
 I FELT
 NOSTALGIC
 FOR
 THE
 GOOD
 OLD DAYS.
 A HIDDEN
 SADNESS
 THAT
 CONDITIONED
 ALL
 THE
 DOOM
 OF AN UNCERTAIN
 AND
 BRUTAL
 FUTURE! 
THE
 YEAR
 WAS
 2045
 AND
 THE
 ENVIRONMENT
 AROUND
 WAS
 A BIT
 LIKE
 CYBERPUNK.
 BUT
 ZONARA
 WAS
 NOT
 IMPRESSED
 BY THE
 FUTURE,
 BUT
 WANTED
 TO TURN
 HIS
 GAZE
 TO THE
 IRRETRIEVABLY
 LOST
 PAST. 
WHAT
 HAD
 CHANGED
 IN THOSE
 TWENTY
 YEARS
 - SAY
 ABSOLUTELY
 NOTHING. 
THE
 SOULLESSNESS
 OF THE
 PEOPLE
 WAS
 BECOMING
 MORE
 AND
 MORE
 OBVIOUS.
 FOR THOSE
 ACCUSTOMED
 TO POST-APOCALYPTIC
 LANDSCAPES,
 THE
 SIGHT
 WOULD
 NOT
 BE SUITABLE. 
83  - "PEOPLE'S
 VALUES
 HAVE
 CHANGED
 A LOT. FELISTER
 WANTED
 TO HELP
 PEOPLE
 AT LEAST
 FIND
 WORK,"
 ZONARA
 SAID
 SADLY. 
I LISTENED
 TO HER
 IN SILENCE,
 PUZZLING
 OVER
 THE
 FINAL
 DESTINATION
 OF OUR
 JOURNEY. 
SUDDENLY
 WE HEARD
 VOICES
 BEHIND
 OUR
 BACKS
 - THEY
 WERE
 HARSH
 AND ROUGH
 - AS IF READY
 TO FIGHT
 US AT ANY MOMENT. 
- "WE USED
 TO RUN ON ROOFTOPS
 AS CHILDREN,
 BUT
 NOW
 YOU
 WON'T
 ESCAPE
 US,"
 SNARLED
 A LARGE
 BANDIT
 WHO
 WAS
 OBVIOUSLY
 TOO
 EXPERIENCED
 IN FIGHTING. 

I HAD
 NO IDEA
 IF ZONARA
 HAD
 THE
 SKILLS
 OF A FIGHTER,
 AND
 I DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO PUT
 IT TO THE
 TEST
 IN PRACTICE,
 BUT
 BEFORE
 FELISTER
 HIRED
 ME,
 I'D
 DONE
 SOME
 BOXING
 AND
 JIU-JITSU
 TRAINING
 - SO I COULD
 DEFEND
 MYSELF
 AGAINST
 THE
 NEIGHBORHOOD
 HOOLIGANS. 

THE
 FIRST
 ONE
 STEPPED
 UP AND
 WANTED
 TO PUNCH
 ME IN THE
 FACE
 - HE WAS
 VERY
 PUMPED
 TO OVERPOWER
 ME. I GRACEFULLY
 GRABBED
 HIS
 WRIST
 AND
 GAVE
 HIM
 AN UNDERCUT
 AND
 EVEN AS HE WAS
 FALLING
 I MANAGED
 TO PUT
 A KNEE
 ON HIS
 TEMPLE.
 I FELT
 HIS
 SKULL
 START
 TO CRUNCH FROM
 THE
 PRESSURE. 
THE
 ZONE
 HAD
 OBVIOUS
LY BEEN
 PRACTICING
 SOME
 SEMBLANCE
 OF AIKIDO,
 BECAUSE
 IT WAS
 TOSSING
 THEM
 AROUND
 LIKE
 SACKS,
 BUT THEIR
 NUMERICAL
 SUPERIORITY
 WAS
 CLEARLY
 GOING
 TO BREAK
 IT SOON. 
- "YOU'RE
 NOT
 GOING
 TO GET
 AWAY
 WITH
 THE
 
 LEGACY
 UNDER
 OUR
 NOSES,"
 ANOTHER
 THUG
 WHO
 WAS SO UGLY
 HE WAS
 HARD
 TO DRAW
 SNARLED,
 "WE'RE
 REPRESENTATIVES
 OF THE
 DRUG 84  CARTELS
 AND
 YOU'RE
 GOING
 TO HAVE
 TO SHARE
 WITH
 US EVEN IF YOU
 DON'T
 WANT
 TO.
 WE HAD
 YOUR
 BACK,
 SO..." 

HIS
 VOICE
 WAS
 MENACING
 AND
 HIS
 FISTS
 WERE
 IRON.
 HE PROBABLY
 COULD
 HAVE
 KNOCKED
 DOWN
 EVEN A HORSE
 WITH
 HIS
 POWERFUL
 FISTS. 
HONESTLY,
 THIS
 KIND
 OF CHILDISH
 BEHAVIOR
 DIDN'T
 SIT
 WELL
 WITH
 ME.
 I DON'T
 KNOW
 IF IT WAS
 TOLERATED
 ON THE
 STREETS
 OF MONTERREY
 OR IN SUIDAD
 JUAREZ,
 WHICH
 BY THE
 WAY
 WAS
 ALSO
 A STARTING
 POINT
 FOR DRUG TRAFFICKING
 TO THE
 US,
 BUT HERE
 WE WERE
 ON US SOIL
 AND
 IT WAS
 MORE
 THAN
 I LIKED.
 I WISHED
 TO CRUSH
 THIS
 ARROGANT
 AND
 ARROGANT
 REPTILE
 WHO
 MOST
 LIKELY
 WANTED
 TO DEPRIVE
 ME OF MY OWN
 SHARE
 - OF WHAT
 DUPLICITOUS
 FATE
 HAD ORDAINED
 TO BE MINE! 
- "IT WON'T
 HAPPEN!,"
 I ROARED
 WITH
 A FIRMNESS
 IN MY VOICE
 THAT
 I HADN'T
 EVEN EXPECTED
 FROM
 MYSELF.
 - "THE
 LOOT WILL
 BE OURS,
 OR IF YOU
 WANT
 IT SO MUCH
 YOU
 WILL
 HAVE
 TO KILL
 US." 
THE
 OTHERS
 SAW
 WHAT
 HAPPENED
 AND
 BROUGHT
 OUT
 CLUBS
 AND
 KNIVES.
 IT FELT
 LIKE
 A DUMB
 HOLLYWOOD
 ACTION
 MOVIE
 - ONLY
 THIS
 TIME
 IT WAS
 REAL.
 THERE
 WERE
 SIX
 OF THEM
 - WELL,
 FIVE
 NOW,
 SINCE
 I'D
 ALREADY
 KNOCKED
 OUT
 ONE
 OF THEM,
 AND
 ONLY
 TWO
 OF US,
 BUT
 BY THE
 TIME
 I CAME
 TO MY SENSES,
 ZONARA
 HAD
 PULLED
 OUT
 HIS
 GUN
 AND
 OPENED
 FIRE.
 THEY
 DIDN'T
 EXPECT
 SUCH
 A DEVELOPMENT
 AND DIDN'T
 HAVE
 TIME
 TO LIE DOWN. 
BUT ONE
 OF THEM
 SWUNG
 HIS
 BAT
 AT HER
 AND
 MANAGED
 TO WOUND
 HER.
 HE MIGHT
 HAVE
 SMASHED
 HER
 HEAD
 IN AND
 HER
 BLOOD
 LEAKED
 OUT.
 HER
 BRAIN
 WASN'T
 HARD
 TO MAKE
 OUT
 UNDER
 THE
 PIECES
 OF HER
 SHATTERED
 SKULL
 EITHER
 - OR SO IT SEEMED
 TO ME,
 FOR I COULD
 SEE EVERYTHING
 AS IF IN A DREAM. 
85  I JUMPED
 TOWARD
 HER,
 GRABBED
 HER
 GUN
 BEFORE
 IT FELL
 INTO
 ANYONE
 ELSE'S
 HANDS,
 AND
 SHOT
 THE
 OTHERS.
 I KILLED
 THOSE
 DOGS! 
I APPROACHED
 HER.
 HER
 FACE
 WAS
 COVERED
 IN BLOOD.
 I TRIED
 TO CLEAN
 IT OFF
 AND
 LOOK HER
 IN THE
 EYE ONE
 LAST
 TIME.
 I HAD
 NO TIME
 TO LOSE,
 FOR LIKE
 ANYTHING
 MORE
 OF THEM
 WOULD
 SOON
 COME
 AND THEN
 THE
 VULTURES
 WOULD
 BE GNAWING
 AT MY BONES
 ON THOSE
 INHOSPITABLE
 ROCKS. 
BUT SHE
 WAS
 DEAD.
 IRRETRIEVABLY
 DEAD.
 I HAD LOST
 MY ONLY
 COMPANION.
 THEN
 I FELT
 TRULY
 ALONE.
 SO ALONE
 AND
 LOST
 THAT
 I FELT
 LIKE
 CRYING
 OUT
 LOUD.
 TO SCREAM
 AND
 TEAR
 MY FLESH
 IN THE
 WILD
 SUFFERING
 OF A MARTYR! 
AND
 THOSE
 DUMB
 ROCKS
 WERE
 WITNESSES
 TO MY FALL.
 I WENT
 AND
 MISTOOK
 THE
 INSOLENT
 TRASH
 FOR MONEY
 OR SOME
 OTHER
 WEAPONS.
 THERE
 WAS
 NOT
 MUCH,
 BUT
 I DID
 NOT
 EXPECT
 TO FIND
 ANY.
 I REMEMBERED
 THE
 MONEY
 BAG
 ON ZONARA.
 THERE,
 HOWEVER,
 I FOUND
 SOMETHING
 THAT
 ALMOST
 MADE
 ME SCREAM
 - THERE
 WERE
 THE
 PIECES
 OF ABRAMELIN
 MAGE'S
 GRIMOIRE.
 THAT'S
 WHY
 SHE
 WAS
 SO NERVOUS
 THE
 WHOLE
 TIME
 - SHE
 WAS
 AFRAID
 I'D
 TAKE
 IT FROM
 HER
 AND
 DUMP
 HER
 IN THE
 MIDDLE
 OF THE
 WASTELAND. 
I DIDN'T
 HAVE
 TIME
 TO THINK,
 BUT
 STILL
 A RATHER
 FRIGHTENING
 THOUGHT
 CROSSED
 MY MIND
 - ZONARA
 WAS
 OBVIOUSLY
 A DOOMED
 SOUL,
 MORE
 UNHAPPY
 THAN
 MYSELF. 
I KNEW
 IT WAS
 POINTLESS,
 BUT
 WE WERE
 TAUGHT
 IN SCHOOL
 THAT
 IF YOU
 PETITIONED
 THE
 MOST
 HIGH,
 YOU
 WOULD
 RECEIVE
 SOME
 FORM
 OF FORGIVENESS
 THAT
 WOULD
 BRING
 PEACE
 TO YOUR
 SOUL. 
BUT EVEN
 BEFORE
 I FOLDED
 MY ARMS
 SOMETHING
 DETERRED
 ME. MY COMPANION'S
 DEATH
 WAS
 IN VAIN?
 86  WHAT
 SHE
 DID
 FOR ME WAS
 UNHEARD
 OF - SHE
 OPENED
 MY WAY. 
I ALSO
 FOUND
 SOME
 INSTRUCTIONS
 TO THE
 GRIMOIRE,
 BUT DECIDED
 IT WASN'T
 THE
 RIGHT
 TIME
 TO GO THROUGH
 THEM
 RIGHT
 HERE. 
THEN
 SUDDENLY
 SHE
 PERKED
 UP.
 APPARENTLY
 SHE
 WAS
 ALIVE.
 I THANKED
 BOTH
 HELL
 AND
 HEAVEN
 FOR THAT!
 SHE
 WAS
 WITH
 ME! - "I
 PULLED
 A LUCKY
 BREAK,"
 SHE
 TOLD
 ME.
 "THE
 PROTECTION
 SPELL
 I DID
 KEPT
 ME FROM
 CERTAIN
 DEATH.
 I MUST
 LOOK
 TERRIBLE,
 DON'T
 I I APPROACHED
 HER
 WITH
 SOME
 RELUCTANCE,
 BUT REALIZED
 SOMETHING
 VERY
 CLEARLY
 - FOR SOME
 REASON
 HER
 SKULL
 WASN'T
 SHATTERED,
 ONLY
 HER CHEEKBONES
 WERE
 SCRAPED.
 APPARENTLY
 THE
 DEMONIC
 VISIONS
 HAD
 TURNED
 ME INTO
 A QUITTER. 
- "WHAT
 THE
 HELL
 IS GOING
 ON?,"
 I SCREAMED,
 "HOW
 ARE
 YOU
 ALIVE
 WHEN
 YOU
 SHOULD
 BE DEAD!" 
- "I'M
 A NECROMANCER,"
 SHE
 REPLIED
 SIMPLY,
 "AND
 MY GIFT
 IS COMMUNICATING
 WITH
 THE DEAD.
 THIS
 OPENED
 SOME
 DOORS
 OF KNOWLEDGE
 FOR ME,
 BUT
 I PAID
 WITH
 MY SOUL.
 I WILL
 NEVER
 BE ALLOWED
 TO GO TO HEAVEN.
 WELL,
 I PROBABLY
 WON'T
 GO TO HELL
 EITHER,
 BUT WHO
 KNOWS,"
 SHE
 FINISHED,
 SPITTING
 BLOOD." 
I TRIED
 TO BANDAGE
 HER
 WOUNDS
 AND
 GIVE
 HER
 SOME
 PSYCHOLOGICAL
 HELP.
 BUT
 SHE
 SEEMED
 TO RECOVER
 QUICKLY
 WITHOUT
 ME. 
- "WE ARE
 SO
 CLOSE,'
 SHE
 TOLD
 ME DREAMILY.
 "ALL
 YOU
 NEED
 IS A LITTLE
 MORE
 PATIENCE
 AND
 YOU
 WILL
 GET
 WHAT
 YOU
 CRAVE
 SO MUCH.
 BUT
 REMEMBER
 THE
 CURSE
 BOUND
 US BOTH.
 THE
 CURSE
 THAT
 HAS
 HAUNTED
 YOU
 THROUGHOUT
 YOUR
 COMPLICATED
 87  TANGLE
 OF LIVES
 UP TO THIS
 ONE.
 THE
 CURSE
 THAT
 ..."
 - SHE
 DID
 NOT
 FINISH. 
I LOOKED
 AT HER
 AND
 I DON'T
 KNOW
 WHY
 I FELT
 THE
 OVERWHELMING
 URGE
 TO HUG
 HER
 TIGHTLY.
 I WOULD
 NOT
 SAY
 THAT
 I LOVED
 HER,
 BUT OUR
 COMMON
 SITUATION
 ADDED
 TO OUR
 AFFECTION. 
- "IT'S
 TIME
 TO GO,"
 I TOLD
 HER,
 "WHAT
 HAS
 TO HAPPEN
 WILL
 JUST
 HAPPEN
 AND
 CAN
 HARDLY
 BE AVOIDED!
 BUT WE SHALL
 BE TOGETHER-TWO
 DOOMED
 SOULS!" 
WE BREAKFASTED
 UNDER
 THE
 SCORCHING
 SUN
 THAT
 MIGHT
 AS WELL
 HAVE
 BEEN
 BURNING. 
THEN
 SHE
 SHARED
 HER
 FINAL
 INTENTIONS
 WITH
 ME. - THE
 RITUAL
 WHICH
 FELISTER
 HAD
 UNDERTAKEN
 TO PERFORM
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 BEEN
 PERFORMED
 BY A YOUNG
 BOY
 OR A VIRGIN.
 HOWEVER,
 THE
 BOY
 DID
 NOT
 HAVE
 THE
 PSYCHE
 TO DEAL
 WITH
 THE
 DEMONS.
 GENERALLY,
 IT WENT
 SACRIFICE
 AND
 HAD
 TO THWART
 HIS
 INFERNAL
 PLANS.
 BUT I DECIDED
 TO FINISH
 THINGS
 OFF! 
- "WHERE
 EXACTLY
 ARE
 WE GOING?,"
 I ASKED
 HER
 IN NO UNCERTAIN
 TERMS,
 WITHOUT
 ANY
 MORE
 PRELIMINARIES. 

- WHEREVER
 IS THE
 BEST
 PLACE
 TO PERFORM
 THE
 RITUAL.
 BUT
 BEFORE
 THAT
 WE HAVE
 SOMETHING
 ELSE
 TO DO THAT
 WILL
 SLOW
 US DOWN
 A BIT. 
I REALLY
 DIDN'T
 KNOW
 WHAT
 TO THINK
 NOW.
 SHE
 WAS
 AS INSCRUTABLE
 AS SHE
 HAD
 BEEN
 AT THE
 BEGINNING,
 BUT I COULD
 SENSE
 HER
 DOOM
 AND
 DESIRE
 TO SAVE
 HERSELF
 - SOMETHING
 I DIDN'T
 THINK
 WAS
 GOING
 TO HAPPEN.
 IN THIS
 WORLD
 AND
 THE
 NEXT! 
THAT
 DOOMED
 ROMANCE
 OF THE
 GOOD
 OLD
 DAYS!
 THAT
 THORNY
 ROAD
 THAT
 LED
 NOWHERE! 
88  ZONARA
 WAS
 QUITE
 BEAUTIFUL
 AFTER
 ALL
 - A SLENDER
 YOUNG
 WOMAN
 DRESSED
 IN HER
 FRUMPY
 RED
 DRESS
 THE
 COLOR
 OF FRESHLY
 DRIED
 BLOOD.
 SHE
 SEEMED
 READY
 FOR ANYTHING! 
THIS
 WOMAN
 URGED
 ME TO FIGHT,
 TO GO FORWARD
 INTO
 THE
 UNKNOWN,
 AND
 HER
 SCENT
 GAVE
 ME THE
 STRANGE
 FEELING
 THAT
 OUR
 DESTINIES
 WERE
 INEVITABLY
 INTERTWINED
 IN A WAY
 THAT
 EVEN I COULD
 HARDLY
 EXPLAIN. 
- "BEAUTY
 IN LIFE
 IS A RELATIVE
 THING,"
 ZONARA
 TURNED
 TO ME, WHISPERING
 WITH
 AN EFFORT
 BECAUSE
 OF THE
 BLOOD
 SHE
 HAD
 LOST,
 "BUT
 I SHALL
 RECOVER
 ONCE
 YOU
 ARE
 BY MY SIDE,
 MY LOVE!" 
I'M
 BACK!
 THAT
 MEANS
 SHE
 LOVED
 ME! THAT
 MEANT
 SHE
 WANTED
 US TO SHARE
 OUR
 WAY
 TOGETHER!
 MEANING... 

I WASN'T
 SOME
 NAIVE
 KID
 WHO
 WOULD
 FALL
 FOR
 BULLSHIT,
 BUT
 IN THIS
 CASE,
 MAYBE
 THERE
 WAS
 SOMETHING
 IN HER
 VOICE.
 SOMETHING
 ENCHANTING
 THAT
 MADE
 ME FEEL
 WHAT
 SHE
 WANTED
 TO TELL
 ME! OF THE TIME
 I SPENT
 A LONG
 TIME
 IN THE
 OLD FELISTER
'S LIBRARY
 - AS WE HAVE
 SAID,
 BESIDES
 BOOKS
 RELATING
 TO DEMONS,
 HE LOVED
 TOO
 MANY
 DIVERSE
 THINGS
 THAT
 COULD
 EXPAND
 HIS
 KNOWLEDGE
 OF WORLD
 HISTORY
 AND
 ITS
 DIFFERENT
 ERAS.
 FELISTER
 WASN'T
 EXACTLY
 A HISTORIAN,
 BUT HE WAS
 AWARE
 OF THE
 WHOLE
 NAIVETY
 OF THE
 SOCIAL
 ORDER,
 WHICH,
 FRANKLY,
 SEEMED RIDICULOUS
 TO HIM.
 THE
 MONEY
 FROM
 HIS
 MERCHANDISE
 FUNDED
 ENTIRE
 SECTORS
 OF THE
 ECONOMY,
 AND
 THEIR
 REPRESENTATIVES
 MADE
 HIGH-FLOWN
 SPEECHES
 ABOUT
 MORALITY
 AND
 HUMAN
 EQUALITY,
 AND
 ALSO
 ABOUT
 THEIR
 UNDERSTANDING
 OF THE
 SOCIALITY
 THEY
 REPRESENTED. 
89  FELISTER
 WAS
 READY
 TO SPIT
 IN THEIR
 FACE
 FOR
 THE
 HYPOCRISY
 THEY
 HAD
 SHOWN. 
AND
 ZONARA
 DID
 NOT
 SEEM
 HYPOCRITICAL,
 BUT
 ON THE
 CONTRARY,
 SHE
 WAS
 TOO GENTLE-NATURED
 AND
 READY
 FOR ADVENTURE. 
I TRIED
 TO HELP
 HER
 THROUGH
 THE
 DIFFICULT
 TRANSITION,
 BUT
 SHE
 SOON
 GOT BETTER
 AND
 MY HELP
 WAS
 ALMOST
 UNNECESSARY.
 APPARENTLY,
 HER
 MAGICAL
 ABILITIES,
 OR DEVIL
 KNOWS
 WHAT,
 WERE
 HELPING
 HER
 TO SHARE
 HER
 PAIN
 AND
 MOVE
 ON. 
MY ZONARA!
 WONDERFUL
 PARTNER
 AND
 THE
 ONE
 WHO
 OPENED
 MY EYES!
 FOR
 A NEW
 LIFE! 
WE CONTINUED
 ON,
 AND
 I NOTICED
 THAT
 SHE
 WAS
 NOW
 SHOWING
 A GREATER
 DESIRE
 FOR
 WHAT
 LAY
 AHEAD. 
- "WE MUST
 ALSO
 COLLECT
 SOME
 OF THE
 OLD
 MAN'S
 MONEY,"
 SHE
 SAID
 TO ME, MATTER-
OF-FACTLY.
 - "MIND
 YOU,
 THE
 GRIMOIRE
 ISN'T
 WORTH
 FIVEPENCE
 IF WE DON'T
 GET
 ENOUGH
 FINANCE,
 TOO.
 SOME
 OF THE
 THINGS
 CONNECTED
 WITH
 THE
 PREPARATION
 OF THE
 RITUAL
 ARE
 TERRIBLY
 EXPENSIVE." 
I TOOK
 HER
 WORDS
 SERIOUSLY. 
- HOW
 MUCH
 SUFFERING
 HAS
 FELISTER
 CAUSED
 IN HIS
 LIFETIME? 

- "TOO MUCH,"
 WAS
 HER
 REPLY.
 "FELISTER
 WAS
 A MAN
 WHO
 WOULD
 STOP
 AT ABSOLUTELY
 NOTHING
 AND
 AT ABSOLUTELY
 NOTHING.
 HE WAS
 PREPARED
 TO KILL
 THE
 ENTIRE
 STAFF
 OF HIS
 OWN
 FARM,
 BUT TO MANAGE
 TO CHEAT
 THE
 CARTELS
 AND
 FUND
 HIS
 DEMONOLOGY
 CLASSES." 

I LOOKED
 AT HER
 AGAIN.
 SHE
 SPOKE
 WITH
 AN EASE
 THAT
 WAS
 UNCHARACTERISTIC
 OF SOMEONE
 WHO
 WAS
 GOING
 TO DIE
 A LITTLE
 EARLY
 - AND
 TODAY,
 OF ALL
 DAYS. 
90  NOW
 WE WERE
 GOING
 TO HAVE
 TO FIND
 THE
 REAL
 PLACE
 FOR THE
 RITUAL,
 AND
 IT SEEMED
 TO ME THAT
 WASN'T
 GOING
 TO GO PAINLESSLY
 OR WITHOUT
 FURTHER
 ACCIDENTS. 
ZONARA
 DIDN'T
 SEEM
 TO BE AVOIDING
 THEM
 EITHER.
 HE DIDN'T
 SHOW
 AN OUNCE
 OF SYMPATHY
 FOR THOSE
 WE HAD
 DEALT
 WITH.
 EVEN
 THOUGH
 THEY
 WERE
 EAGER
 TO ELIMINATE
 HER
 AND
 ACTED
 LIKE
 A WELL-TRAINED
 STREET
 GANG. 
- "WHO
 EXACTLY
 WERE
 THEY?,"
 I ASKED
 HER. 
- MEXICAN
 CARTELS
 USUA
LLY HAD
 DEBT
 COLLECTORS
 WHO
 WERE
 ALSO
 RESPONSIBLE
 FOR SOME
 SECONDARY
 ROUTES
 OF TRAFFICKING
 THE
 GOODS.
 BASICALLY,
 THESE
 GUYS
 SEEMED
 TO BE PART
 OF THOSE
 GROUPS,
 AND
 YET
 THEY
 WERE
 DANGEROUS
 ENOUGH.
 BUT
 YOU
 AIN'T
 SEEN NOTHING
 YET! 
I ALWAYS
 WONDERED
 ABOUT
 THE
 PSYCHE
 OF THESE
 THUGS,
 READY
 TO KILL
 YOU
 FOR
 PENNIES. 
IN MY WORLD
 FELISTER
 DISPENSED
 JUSTICE
 DIRECTLY
 - HE DIDN'T
 CARE
 AND PUNISHED
 JUST
 FINE.
 WHEN
 HE HAD
 TO,
 HE EVEN
 CUT
 THE
 HANDS
 OF HIS
 DEALERS,
 SO NO ONE
 DARED
 TO STEAL
 FROM
 HIM
 OR HIDE
 ANY
 IMPORTANT
 INFORMATION
 FROM
 HIM. 
FELISTER
'S FARM
 WAS
 A LIVING
 HELL
 - IT WAS
 A VERITABLE
 FACTORY
 OF DEATH! 
 
CHAPTER
 TEN:
 IN SEARCH
 OF SUPPORT 
 
THE
 NEXT
 PART
 OF OUR
 ITINERARY
 WITH
 ZONARA
 WAS
 TO TAKE
 A PISS
 IN SALT
 LAKE
 CITY
 BEFORE
 WE LEFT
 FOR DENVER
 IN THE
 STATE
 OF COLORAD
O. THERE
 WE WERE
 ABLE
 TO REST
 AND
 EAT. 
91  OVER
 THE
 YEARS
 I HAD
 WITNESSED
 THAT
 ALL
 THE
 SO-CALLED
 PSEUDO-FRIENDS
 WHO
 HAD
 COME
 INTO
 MY LIFE
 HAD
 DONE
 SO ONLY
 FOR PROFIT,
 BUT FORTUNATELY
 FOR
 ME,
 THE
 POSITION
 OF ASSISTANT
 CASTRATO
 AT THE
 FELISTER
 FARM
 GAVE
 ME A MEASURE
 OF PROTECTION. 
SALT
 LAKE
 CITY
 WAS
 TRULY
 MAGNIFICENT
 - IT WAS
 THE
 CAPITAL
 OF UTAH,
 WHERE
 THE
 MAJESTIC
 RIDGES
 OF THE
 MOUNTAINS
 STOOD
 OUT
 BEHIND
 THE
 SO-CALLED
 DOWNTOWN
3, WHERE
 THE
 ENTERPRISING
 CITY
 GOVERNMENT
 BUILT
 MORE
 AND
 MORE
 NEW
 BUILDINGS. 
HERE
 FOR THE FIRST
 TIME
 WE HAD
 THE
 OPPORTUNITY
 TO CHANGE
 AND
 BATHE,
 STAYING
 IN ONE
 OF THE
 BEST
 HOTELS. 

- "WE CAN'T
 STAY
 HERE
 TOO LONG,"
 I TOLD
 HER.
 "I
 HAVE
 A FEELING
 WE'LL
 SOON
 BE IN TROUBLE."
 BUT SO FAR,
 NOTHING
 PORTENDED
 A STORM
 ON THE
 HORIZON.
 THE
 SKY
 WAS
 CRYSTAL
 CLEAR,
 AND
 THE
 PLEASANT
 LIGHT
 BREEZE
 BLOWING
 IN FROM
 THE
 MOUNTAINS
 WAS
 DOWNRIGHT
 LOVELY.
 NEXT
 TO THIS
 TOWN
 WAS
 THE
 FAMOUS
 LAKE,
 WHOSE
 GENTLE
 WAVES
 WHISPERED
 ENCHANTINGLY.
 DO YOU
 KNOW,
 MANY
 PEOPLE
 ARE
 SO SELF-ABSORBED
 THAT
 THEY
 MISS
 THE
 MOST
 IMPORTANT
 THIN
GS IN LIFE?
 AND
 THAT
 IS TO LIVE! 
SALT
 LAKE
 CITY
 WAS
 FOR A LONG
 TIME
 A FAMOUS
 CENTRE
 WHERE
 EXTREMELY
 USEFUL
 AND
 VALUABLE
 CONTACTS
 COULD
 BE MADE.
 FORTUNATELY
 FOR
 ME, THE
 ZONE
 HAD
 THEM
 IN ABUNDANCE,
 AND
 THAT
 WAS
 ONLY
 WELCOME
 FOR US. 
WE CONTACTED
 A YUPPIE
 NAMED
 JAKE,
 A WELL-
EDUCATED
 YOUNG
 PARVENU,
 WHO
 EXPLAINED
 THAT
 IN ORDER
 TO MOVE
 AROUND
 MORE
 SAFELY
 GIVEN
 THE
 FACTS
 LAID
 OUT
 BEFORE
 HIM,
 IT WAS
 NOT
 A BAD IDEA
                                                
 3 Downtown - central part of the city. 
92  TO SEEK
 POLICE
 PROTECTION.
 BOTH
 ZONARA
 AND
 I REJECTED
 HIS
 OFFER
 FLATLY. 
GOOD
 YUPPIES
 ARE
 ALWAYS
 WILLING
 TO HELP
 YOU
 IF YOU
 PAY
 THEM
 WELL
 ENOUGH,
 AND
 ZONARA
 HAD
 A BAG
 FULL
 OF MONEY.
 I DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO INTERFERE
 IN THAT
 KIND
 OF RELATIONSHIP.
 I ALSO
 DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO PRY,
 AS A LOT
 OF THINGS
 HADN'T
 BEEN
 THE
 SAME
 SINCE
 I LEFT
 FELISTER
'S FARM,
 AND
 I WAS
 PROBABLY
 THE
 ONLY
 SURVIVOR
 WHILE
 FELISTER
'S BODY
 LAY
 ON THE
 AUTOPSY
 TABLE
 AND
 WAS
 PROBABLY
 IN THE
 CEMETERY
 LONG
 AGO. 
HE THEN
 TURNED
 TO US SAYING: 
- YOU
 KNOW,
 YOU'RE
 THE
 STRANGEST
 CLIENTS
 I'VE
 EVER HAD,
 BUT YOU'RE
 DEFINITELY
 INTERESTING
 TO ME! SO I'LL
 DO SOMETHING
 FOR
 YOU,
 BUT
 IN RETURN
 YOU'LL
 TAKE
 ME TO THE
 RITUAL
 AND
 I GET
 TO TALK
 TO THE
 GHOST! 
ZONARA
 WAS
 RELUCTANT
 TO AGREE,
 BUT
 AFTER
 SOME
 THOUGHT,
 SHE
 RELENTED. 
HE EVEN AGREED
 TO DRIVE
 US IN HIS
 OWN
 CAR. 
- YOU
 WILL
 ATTRACT
 UNNECESSARY
 ATTENTION,
 PLUS
 SOME
 OF THE
 THOROUGHFARES
 ARE
 NOW
 UNDER
 STRICT
 POLICE
 CONTROL.
 NO NEED
 TO THANK
 ME.
 I DO IT FROM
 THE
 BOTTOM
 OF MY HEART. 
HE EXPLAINED
 TO US HOW
 HE HAD
 HELPED
 MANY
 TRAFFICKERS
 IN THE
 PAST
 WHO
 HAD
 PROBLEMS
 WITH
 THE
 LAW
 AND
 WHO
 DEFINITELY
 WOULD
 NOT
 HAVE
 SURVIVED
 WITHOUT
 HIS
 HELP. 
- WHEN
 WE HAVE
 DONE
 OUR
 WORK
 IN THIS
 WORLD,
 WE HAVE
 TO LEAVE!"
 HE JOKED,
 "IT'S
 PART
 OF THE
 CIRCLE
 OF LIFE,
 BUT
 I DON'T
 WANT
 TO MAKE
 YOU
 MAKE
 THE
 WRONG
 DECISIONS.
 NOR
 TO HURRY WITHOUT
 NEED!
 SALT
 LAKE
 CITY
 IS NOT
 SUCH
 A PLEASANT
 PLACE,
 93  HOWEVER
 MUCH
 THE
 GENTLE
 BREEZE
 AND
 BEAUTIFUL
 SCENERY
 MAY
 IMPRESS
 YOU.
 I'VE
 HAD
 A REAL
 STRONG
 URGE
 TO MOVE
 AWAY
 FOR YEARS
 TOO.
 I JUST
 DON'T
 FEEL
 LIKE
 COMING
 HERE.
 MY WHITE
 COLLAR
 CAREER
 IS OVER
 - EVERYTHING
 HERE
 IS SO BRUTALLY
 FAKE
 AND
 POINTLESS
 - AS IS ALL
 HUMAN
 LIFE,
 BY THE WAY.
 YOU
 KNOW,
 I SPEAK
 SO FRANKLY
 TO YOU
 AS TO FRIENDS
 I BARELY
 KNOW,
 BUT
 PERHAPS
 OUR
 FATES
 ARE
 INVARIABLY
 LINKED
 AND
 THIS
 ADVENTURE
 IS A SHARED
 AFFAIR.
 I AM READY
 TO BE WITH
 YOU
 AND
 TO GET
 OUT
 OF THE
 DRY AND
 HECTIC
 EVERYDAY
 LIFE.
 UNEMPLOYMENT
 IS SKYROCKETING
 AS IT IS,
 AND
 THE
 BUILDING
 TRADE
 UNIONS
 HAVE
 TAKEN
 OVER
 THE
 ENTIRE
 REAL
 SECTOR
 - FRANKLY,
 THEY'RE
 UNBREATHABLE.
  IT WAS
 SUCH
 A STUPID
 DECISION
 TO PURSUE
 A LEGAL
 CAREER.
 I THOUGHT
 I WAS
 HELPING
 OTHERS,
 BUT
 I WAS
 ACTUALLY
 LIVING
 THEIR
 LIVES.
 IT WASN'T
 RIGHT,
 IT WAS
 MORE
 LIKE
 A MISTAKE.
 BUT
 MY PARENTS
 WERE
 RICH
 AND
 BASICALLY
 WANTED
 THE
 BEST
 FOR ME.
 I SOON
 REALIZED
 THAT
 I WAS
 ON THE
 WRONG
 PATH,
 BUT
 THERE
 WAS
 NO TURNING
 BACK. 
- "I
 MET ZONARA
 SOON,
 AND
 SHE
 IS SO IMPRESSIVE,"
 I MUTTERED. 

WHEN
 ZONARA
 COULDN'T
 HEAR
 US,
 JAKE
 TURNED
 TO ME IN A FRIENDLY
 WAY.
  - MANY
 THINGS
 IN THIS
 WORLD
 ARE
 TOO DECEPTIVE.
 I WOULDN'T
 TRUST
 HER
 IF I WERE
 YOU.
 NOT
 EVERYTHING
 IS AS IT SEEMS.
 AND
 MAYBE
 SHE'S
 NOT
 SO WELL-
MEANING. 

I PONDERED
 HIS
 WORDS-PERHAPS
 THE
 MODERN
 MELANCHOLY
 LOOK
 OF SALT
 LAKE
 CITY
 HAD
 GONE
 TO MY HEAD
 AND SHIFTED
 MY FOCUS
 FROM
 WHAT
 WAS
 TRULY
 IMPORTANT.
 HONESTLY,
 I WONDERED
 WHAT
 KIND
 OF PEOPLE
 LIVED
 THERE
 - TECHNOCRATS,
 94  INDIANS,
 YUPPIES,
 ATHLETES.
 AND
 FINALLY
 I JUST
 GOT A HEADACHE. 
DROVE
 US AROUND
 IN HIS
 VOLVO
 - AN SUV SEDAN,
 AS HE THOUGHT
 THAT
 KIND
 OF CAR
 WAS
 MORE
 MANLY
 AND
 RELIABLE
 ON THE
 ROAD
 - ESPECIALLY
 OFF-ROAD
 DRIVING.
 NOT
 THAT
 HE WAS
 A GEEK,
 BUT HE WANTED
 HIS
 CAR
 TO BE FIT FOR ALL
 CONDITIONS.
 I COULD
 AGREE
 WITH
 HIM
 - WHERE
 HE WAS
 TAKING
 US THOUGH
 WAS
 UNKNOWN. 

AFTER
 MORE
 THAN
 TWO
 HOURS
 WE STOPPED
 IN FRONT
 OF A SHACK
 THAT
 WAS
 LOCATED
 GOD
 KNOWS
 WHERE. 
 - "THERE
 ARE
 A LOT
 OF INDIANS
 LIVING
 IN THIS
 AREA.
 WELL,
 NOT
 THAT
 MANY,
 ACTUALLY,"
 HE ADDED.
 "MOST
 OF THEM
 UNDERSTAND
 MAGIC,
 ALTHOUGH
 WHAT
 FELISTER
 DID
 SEEMED
 SINISTER
 ENOUGH.
 I CAN'T
 EVEN IMAGINE
 WHAT
 REAL
 DEMONS
 LOOK LIKE
 - IT DOESN'T
 CROSS
 MY MIND." 
WE ENTERED
 THE
 TYPICAL
 INDIAN
 TENT,
 WHICH
 WAS
 CALLED
 A TEPEE,
 AND
 WHICH
 HONESTLY
 LOOKED
 PRETTY
 FUN. 
- THE
 GOVERNMENT
 GRANTED
 THEM
 SOME
 LAND.
 IT WASN'T
 EASY
 FOR THEM
 TO GET
 ENOUGH
 PRIVILEGES
 TO SURVIVE.
 NO ONE
 WANTED
 THEM
 AND
 IT WAS
 RUINING
 THEM,
 BUT
 IN THE
 END
 SOMEONE
 NEEDED
 THEM
 ANYWAY.
 ONCE
 UPON
 A TIME,
 FROM
 WHAT
 I'VE
 HEARD,
 OF COURSE,
 SOMEWHERE
 OUT
 THERE
 AROUND
 THE
 FRESHWATER
 LAKES
 AND
 STREAMS
 CAME
 THEIR
 FIRST
 DESCENDANTS.
 BUT
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND
 SALT
 LAKE
 CITY
 WAS
 FOUNDED
 BY MORMONS. 
THE
 MORMON
 FAITH
 WAS
 PECULIAR
 - YES, IT WAS
 TRUE
 THAT
 THERE
 WERE
 ALL
 SORTS
 OF CHRISTIAN
 SECTS
 LIKE
 THE
 "BRANCH
 OF DAVID",
 THE
 "SEVENTH
 DAY
 ADVENTISTS"
 AND
 SO ON,
 BUT
 THE
 MORMONS
 HAD
 A VERY
 STABLE
 FAMILY
 STRUCTURE. 
95  - "WE ARE
 ALL
 TEMPORARY
 VISITORS
 TO THIS
 WORLD
 AND
 NEED
 NOT
 EXPECT
 APPROVAL
 OR DISAPPROVAL
 FOR OUR
 ACTIONS.
 IF YOU
 REALLY
 THINK
 ABOUT
 IT,
 ONE
 MUST
 BE SELF-SUFFICIENT,
 AS TRUE
 LOVE
 DOES
 NOT
 EXIST!"
 HE REVEALED
 HIS
 PHILOSOPHY.
 "FELISTER
 LIVED
 BY HIS
 OWN
 RULES
 AND
 WITNESSED
 HIS
 OWN
 VERY
 SAD
 END
 INDEED.
 'BUT
 ENERGY
 IS NOT
 LOST,
 IT ONLY
 PASSES
 FROM
 ONE
 STATE
 TO ANOTHER,"
 HE SHARED
 HIS
 RATHER
 BANAL
 VIEWS. 
WE THEN
 WENT
 INSIDE
 AND
 A RATHER
 ELDERLY
 INDIAN
 WOMAN
 WAS
 WAITING
 FOR
 US - APPARENTLY
 JAKE HAD
 BEEN
 HELPING
 THEM
 WITH
 THIS
 AND
 THAT
 TO ARRANGE
 THEIR
 RIGHT
 OF ABODE.
 THERE
 WERE
 ALSO
 QUITE
 A FEW
 NGOS
 DEFENDING
 THEIR
 RIGHTS
 AS WELL.
 OR PRETENDED
 THEY
 REALLY
 DID. 
- "I
 SEE YOU
 WELL,
 YOUNG
 MAN,"
 THE
 STRANGE
 WOMAN
 TURNED
 TO ME,
 "YOU
 ARE
 NOT
 LIKE
 THE
 OTHERS
 BECAUSE
 YOU
 WERE
 NEVER
 BORN.
 OR YOU
 WERE
 BORN
 DEAD.
 YOUR
 LINE
 OF DESTINY
 IS RATHER
 CONFUSED,
 BUT I SEE INTO
 THE
 FUTURE.
 THERE
 ARE
 NO HIDDEN
 SECRETS
 FOR ME." 
IT WAS
 VERY
 QUIET
 INSIDE
 FOR
 A WHILE
 AND
 NOTHING
 COULD
 BE HEARD. 
AND
 IF ANY
 MINIMAL
 LIGHT
 CAME
 IN AT ALL,
 IT WAS
 FROM
 THE
 TWO
 SMOKE
 DIRECTIONAL
 DAMPERS. 
HER
 FACE
 WAS
 LINED
 WITH
 A MULTITUDE
 OF WRINKLES,
 WHICH
 MUST
 HAVE
 BEEN
  AFTER
 A MOMENT'S
 SILENCE,
 THE
 WOMAN
 CALLED: 
- I TRIED
 TO COMMUNICATE
 WITH
 THE
 SPIRITS
 AND
 THEY
 WOULDN
'T GIVE
 ME AN ANSWER
 - AT LEAST
 NOT
 RIGHT
 AWAY.
 BUT
 AFTER
 A WHILE
 I MADE
 CONTACT.
 OUR
 MAGIC
 IS FOR RAIN,
 FOR
 BIRTH
 OR DEATH
 AND
 SO ON.
 BUT HOW
 CAN
 I HELP
 YOU,
 SINCE
 YOU
 WERE
 NEVER
 BORN
 AND
 NEVER
 DIED?
 YOUR
 SITUATION
 IS QUITE
 96  CONFUSED
 AND
 I'M
 AFRAID
 MY POWE
RS AS A SHAMAN
 WON'T
 BE ENOUGH
 TO SAVE
 YOU.
 AND
 MAYBE
 YOU
 HAVE
 TO FIND
 YOUR
 OWN
 WAY,
 BUT
 I CAN
 TELL
 YOU
 ONE
 THING
 FOR
 SURE
 - THE
 GREAT
 SPIRIT
4 IS ALSO
 SILENT,
 AND
 I DON'T
 KNOW
 WHETHER
 TO SEE THIS
 AS A BLESSING
 OR A CURSE!
 YOU
 WILL
 HAVE
 TO GO ON! 
JAKE
 DIDN'T
 INTERVENE,
 BUT ZONARA
 DECIDED
 TO JOIN
 THE
 CONVERSATION: 
- AND
 WHAT
 DO YOU
 SEE
 OF THE
 
 LEGACY
... THE
 WOMAN
 WAS
 SILENT
 FOR A MOMENT
 AND
 TURNED
 AWAY: 

- DIFFICULT
 QUESTION
 YOU
 ASK
 ME. FELISTER
 WASN'T
 AS UNCLEAN
 AS YOU
 THOUGHT
 HIM
 TO BE,
 BUT
 HIS
 COMMUNICATION
 WITH
 DEMONS
 HAD
 FAILED
 HIM.
 THERE
 IS NO TREASURE
 IN HIS
 FARM
 - EXCEPT
 THE
 GRIMOIRE
 BOOKS,
 AND
 THEY
 ARE
 A SOURCE
 OF KNOWLEDGE,
 NOT
 SO MUCH
 OF AVARICE
 AND
 HATRED
 OF HUMANS! 
I FELT,
 HOWEVER,
 A STRANGE
 PRESENCE
 IN THIS
 INDIAN
 TEPEE
 - AS IF SOMETHING
 INVISIBLE
 WAS
 FOLLOWING
 US,
 AND
 IT WOULD
 CAUSE
 OR INFLUENCE
 THE
 OUTCOME
 OF LATER
 EVENTS. 
WE BY-PASSED
 SALT
 LAKE
 CITY
 AND
 DROVE
 ON TO DENVER
 COLORADO,
 WHERE
 THE
 REAL
 SEARCH
 FOR THE
 TRAIL
 LEADING
 TO THE PROPER
 PLACE
 FOR
 THE
 RITUAL
 WAS
 TO BEGIN. 
I NOTICED
 THAT
 ZONARA
 WASN'T
 TOO
 TALKATIVE
 ON THE
 WAY,
 BUT THEN
 SHE
 RELAXED.
 IT WAS
 AS IF A CERTAIN
 CHANGE
 HAD
 COME
 OVER
 HER.
 I'M
 NOT
 CONVINCED
 THAT
 SHE
 BELIEVED
 ANY
 SHAMANIC
                                                
 4 Kichi Manitou is one of the names of the Great Spirit w
ho is 
also known as Wakan Tanka. 
97  SHENANIGANS
 THAT
 COULD
 FOOL
 THE
 MIND
 AND
 LEAD
 YOU
 TO HELL. 
THE
 THREE
 OF US MERRILY
 CHATTED
 ABOUT
 WHAT
 LAY
 AHEAD
 TO FIND
 THE
 SECRETS
 OF THE
 SHADOWY
 FELISTER. 

DENVER
 COLORADO
 HAD
 LONG
 AGO
 DECRIMINALIZED
 THE
 USE
 OF HALLUCINOGENIC
 MUSHROOMS,
 BUT ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND,
 THE
 OLD
 FELISTER
 LIKED
 TO SAY: 
- WE PRODUCE
 THE
 REAL
 STUFF,
 BOYS.
 AND
 THE
 CATTLE
 INDUSTRY
 IS BOOMING
 IN THIS
 COUNTRY!
 FORGET
 CROP
 PRODUCTION!
 WE CREATE
 THE
 REAL
 VALUE-ADDED! 

HE DEFINITELY
 HAD
 A PERVERSE
 ENOUGH
 SENSE
 OF HUMOR! 

FELISTER
'S ANTICS
 WERE
 UNIVERSALLY
 KNOWN,
 BUT I GUARANTEE
 YOU
 THEY
 WERE
 FAR
 FROM
 CHAOTIC
 OR MINDLESS!
 NO THIS
 MAN
 WAS
 A GENIUS
 OF VIOLENCE
 AND
 TERROR! 
AFTER
 A CAREFUL
 EXAMINATION
 OF THE
 MAP
 OF CRIMES
 IN DENVER,
 WE NOTICED
 THAT
 THEY
 WERE
 CONCENTRATED
 IN THE
 CENTRAL
 AND NORTHWESTERN
 PARTS.
 WE HAD
 TO RECRUIT
 SOMEONE
 TO HELP
 US BECAUSE
 IT WAS
 JUST
 THE
 THREE
 OF US,
 AND
 MAYBE
 SOMEONE
 ELSE
 HAD
 GONE
 AFTER
 US. 
THE
 EXPERIENCE
 WE HAD
 GAINED
 IN OUR
 THREE-WEEK
 STAY
 IN SALT
 LAKE
 CITY
 HAD
 TAUGHT
 ME ONE
 THING.
 SOMETIMES
 YOU
 CAN
 FIND
 COLLABORATORS
 MUCH
 MORE
 EFFECTIVELY
 WHEN
 YOU
 POINT
 OUT
 TO THEM
 YOUR
 COMMON
 INTERESTS,
 BECAUSE
 ANYONE
 CAN MAKE
 MONEY! 
WE SPENT
 THE
 NIGHT
 AT ONE
 OF THE
 MANY
 HOTELS
 IN TOWN.
 NO REASON
 TO GET
 INTO
 TRITE
 AND
 REDUNDANT
 DESCRIPTIONS,
 BUT
 WE FOUND
 JAKE
 DEAD
 IN THE
 98  MORNING.
 HE HAD
 GLAZED
 OVER
 HIS
 EYES LIKE
 A DOG!
 IT
 WAS
 UNNECESSARY
 TO TELL
 ME THAT
 THE
 MALIGNANT
 CURSE
 OF THE
 FELISTER
 HIMSELF
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 BEEN
 DIRECTED
 AFTER
 US. 
HE WAS
 PROBABLY
 CHASING
 US FROM
 THE
 GRAVE,
 ANGRY
 THAT
 WE WERE
 SO SLOW
 TO FIND
 WHAT
 WE NEEDED
 AND
 COMPLETE
 THE
 RITUAL
 ONCE
 AND
 FOR ALL. 

CRIME
 IN A CITY
 RISES
 WHEN
 THE
 CITY
 GOVERNMENT
 IS UNABLE
 OR UNWILLING
 TO DEAL
 WITH
 IT. 
- "WE FOUND
 JAKE
 SMILING!,"
 I SAID
 THOUGHTFULLY.
 "HE MUST
 HAVE
 DIED
 REALLY
 HAPPY.
 HE OBVIOUSLY
 ENJOYED
 BEING
 LEFT
 ALONE
 WITH
 DEATH!
 MAYBE
 HE DIDN'T
 HAVE
 ANY
 FRIENDS
 IN HIS
 LIFETIME!" 
ZONARA
 SAID
 NOTHING
 AGAIN.
 APPARENTLY,
 SHE
 HAD TAKEN
 SOME
 STRANGE
 VOW
 OF SILENCE.
 HER
 FACE
 REMAINED
 ABSOLUTELY
 IMPENETRABLE,
 AND
 I WAS
 UNABLE
 TO MAKE
 IT OUT. 
JAKE'S
 OX COULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 USED
 AT LEAST
 A LITTLE
 LONGER,
 BUT
 I STILL
 DECIDED
 TO EXAMINE
 HIS
 CORPSE
 BEFORE
 THE
 PARAMEDICS
 ARRIVED,
 AND
 THEN
 HIS
 BODY
 WOULD
 BE SENT
 TO THE
 MORGUE
 TO THE
 PATHOLOGISTS. 

I TOUCHED
 IT WITH
 GLOVES
 SO IT WOULDN'T
 BE RECOGNIZED.
 AND
 ZONARA
 WASN'T
 WATCHING
 ME,
 BECAUSE
 AT THAT
 MOMENT
 HE WAS
 ON THE
 PHONE
 TO 911, AS WAS
 HIS TURN. 
AFTER
 EXAMINING
 HIM
 CAREFULLY,
 I FOUND
 A NOTE
 IN HIS
 MOUTH: 
- YOU'RE
 NEXT!
 BE CAREFUL!
 FELISTER
 WARNS
 YOU!
 HE LOVED
 YOU
 LIKE
 A NATIVE
 SON! 
99  THE
 MENTION
 OF FELISTER
'S NAME
 ASTONISHED
 ME, AND
 I MYSELF
 HAD
 NO IDEA
 HOW
 FAR
 THIS
 WHOLE
 BUSINESS
 MIGHT
 EXTEND. 
THE
 PECULIAR
 THING
 ABOUT
 IT WAS
 THAT
 ZONARA
 HADN'T
 FOUND
 THE
 NOTE,
 WHICH
 PUZZLED
 ME,
 BUT ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND
 SHE
 WAS
 PROBABLY
 JUST
 IN SHOCK
 AND
 HADN'T
 MANAGED
 TO CHECK
 THE
 BODY
 LIKE
 I HAD. 
I QUICKLY
 BACKED
 AWAY
 FROM
 HIM
 SO HE WOULDN'T
 SUSPECT
 MY FIND.
 BUT THE
 FEELING
 FOR THIS
 FATAL
 WOMAN
 WAS
 GROWING
 STRONGER!
 APPARENTLY
 SHE
 COULD
 HAVE
 CAUSED
 A WHOLE
 SERIES
 OF MURDERS
 THAT
 WERE
 UNPREDICTABLE! 
IT WAS
 FRIGHTENING
 TO THINK
 WHAT
 WAS
 HAPPENING
 ALL
 THE
 TIME: 
- "MAYBE
 JAKE
 WAS
 GIVEN
 HIS
 FIRST
 OPPORTUNITY
 TO PASS
 THROUGH
 THE
 LIGHT!,"
 I WHISPERED
 SO SOFTLY
 IT WAS
 IMPOSSIBLE
 FOR ANYONE
 ELSE
 TO HEAR
 ME. ZONARA
 RETURNED
 AND
 WE BOTH
 WAITED
 QUIETLY
 FOR THE
 POLICE
 TEAM.
 HE CAME
 ALMOST
 LIKE
 CLOCKWORK
 EVEN THOUGH
 THERE
 WAS
 TRAFFIC
 CONGESTION
 IN THE
 CITY
 AND
 IT WASN'T
 UNEXPECTED
 FOR THINGS
 LIKE
 THIS
 TO HAPPEN
 TO PEOPLE. 
THE
 DETECTIVE
 WHO
 CAME,
 HOWEVER,
 WAS
 PARTICULARLY
 ROASTED.
 BUT
 HE GAVE
 NO INDICATION
 THAT
 HE KNEW
 ABOUT
 THIS
 CASE.
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN'S
 DEATH
 WAS
 ALL
 TOO
 TELLING,
 AND
 HE HAD
 ALREADY
 LEARNED
 ABOUT
 IT FROM
 HIS
 COLLEAGUES
 IN MISSOURI.
 INFORMATION
 WAS
 INDEED
 MOVING
 AT SPEEDS
 MANY
 TIMES
 THE
 SPEED
 OF SOUND. 
THE
 COP
 LOOKED
 AROUND
 THE
 SCENE
 MOST
 APPRECIATIVELY,
 NOTING
 JAKE'S
 APPARENT
 DEMISE.
 HE INFORMED
 US ONLY
 THAT
 HE HAD
 NO PARENTS
 ACCORDING
 TO THE
 POLICE
 REPORT
 AND
 COULD
 NOT
 PRACTICALLY
 BE BURIED
 WITHOUT
 MUNICIPAL
 100 
 INTERVENTION,
 WHICH
 WOULD
 PROBABLY
 DISPOSE
 OF
 HIS
 PROPERTY
 OR AT LEAST
 HELP
 THE
 STATE
 TO DO SO. 
- "AFTER
 ALL,
 JAKE
 WAS
 ACTUALLY
 WEALTHY,
 ADDING
 HIS
 ANNUAL
 SALARY
 TO THE
 JOHNSON
 LAW
 FIRM
 OF APPROXIMATELY
 ONE
 HUNDRED
 AND
 FIFTY
 THOUSAND
 DOLLARS
 PLUS
 HIS
 PRIVATE
 PRACTICE.
 WELL,
 MAYBE
 THIS
 GUY
 WAS
 WORTH
 ABOUT
 TWO
 AND
 A HALF
 MILLION
 DOLLARS
 IN HIS
 LIFETIME.
 WHEN
 YOU
 THINK
 HOW
 MANY
 ORPHANS
 HE COULD
 HAVE
 HELPED
 WITH
 THAT
 KIND
 OF MONEY
 - A LOT,
 REALLY,"
 MUTTERED
 THE
 OFFICER,
 WHO
 HAD
 GOTTEN
 SOME
 INFORMATION
 FROM
 THE
 POLICE
 REPORT
 AND
 WAS
 NOW
 SCRATCHING
 HIS
 HEAD
 IN PUZZLEMENT. 

THE
 OLD COP
 COUGHED
 - HE WANTED
 TO BELIEVE
 WHAT
 WAS
 PROFITABLE
 TO BELIEVE,
 AND
 SEE WHAT
 WAS
 PROFITABLE
 TO SEE,
 AND
 THAT
 WAS
 HIS
 DEFENCE
 MECHANISM.
 IT WAS
 HOW
 HE'D
 SURVIVED
 IN THE
 JUNGLE
 OF LIFE,
 AND
 HE CONSIDERED
 SUCH
 BEHAVIOR
 TO BE PERFECTLY
 IN ORDER.
 THE
 SUBTLE
 POINT
 WAS
 THAT
 IN THE
 SOCIAL
 JUNGLE
 YOU
 CANNOT
 GET
 ALONG
 WITHOUT
 HAVING
 YOUR
 OWN
 SOCIAL
 IDENTITY,
 AND
 WHEN
 YOU
 DON'T
 HAVE
 A REAL
 ONE
 YOU
 ARE
 FORCED
 TO HIDE
 BEHIND
 THE
 FORMAL
 ONE
 THAT
 YOUR
 PROFESSION
 OR POSITION
 PROVIDES. 
CAREERISM
 IN THE
 POLICE
 WAS
 NOT
 LOOKED
 UPON
 WITH
 A KIND
 EYE, AS IT WAS
 EVERYWHERE,
 BUT
 FRANKLY
 THERE
 WERE
 OTHER
 METHODS
 OF DEALING
 WITH
 THE
 PROBLEM. 
THE
 FINGERPRINT
 TECHNICIANS
 HAD
 TO FINGERPRINT
 THE
 VICTIM
 BECAUSE
 WE WERE
 AUTOMATICALLY
 PLACED
 UNDER
 SUSPICION,
 AT LEAST
 UNTIL
 THE
 CASE
 WAS
 CLEARED
 UP.
 THE
 SPECIALISTS
 WOULD
 USE
 THE
 PAPILLARY
 LINES
 ON HIS
 PALM
 TO REPORT
 EXACTLY
 WHAT
 HE HAD
 OR HAD
 NOT
 TOUCHED.
 WELL,
 IT HAD
 TO BE ACCOUNTED
 FOR,
 TOO,
 THAT
 THIS
 DISTINCTIVE
 FINGER-PAINTING
 WAS
 COMPLETELY
 INDELIBLE. 
101 
 IT WOULD
 NOT BE SUPERFLUOUS
 TO MENTION
 THAT
 THE
 FINGERPRINT
 FILM
 ITSELF,
 SILICONE
 RESINS
 AND
 FLUORESCENT
 SUBSTANCES
 WERE
 USED
 FOR
 THIS
 PURPOSE.
  THE
 TWO
 OF US WITH
 THE
 ZONE
 STOOD
 IN GRIM
 ANTICIPATION
 FOR THE
 IMMINENT
 OUTCOME
 OF THE
 CASE.
 BUT THE
 MORE
 TIME
 PASSED,
 THE MORE
 I REALIZED
 THAT
 NOTHING
 WAS
 GOING
 TO HAPPEN.
 EITHER
 ZONARA
 HAD
 BEEN
 REALLY
 SNEAKY,
 OR WE JUST
 HAD
 TO STAY
 AND
 WATCH
 HOW
 FAR
 THE
 COPS
 WOULD
 GO IN THEIR
 ZEAL
 TO FIND
 CLUES. 
NATURALLY,
 NOTHING
 HAPPENED
 AND
 WE WERE
 BOTH
 ALLOWED
 TO LEAVE,
 BUT
 BEFORE
 THAT
 WE STOPPED
 BY THE
 STATION
 FOR FURTHER
 QUESTIONING. 
WE WERE
 THEN
 FINALLY
 RELEASED. 
OF COURSE,
 WE COULDN'T
 USE
 HIS
 CAR
 AS ORIGINALLY
 INTENDED,
 AND
 ZONARA
 HAD
 TO IMPLICITLY
 ADMIT
 HIS
 DEFEAT.
 BUT
 SHE
 DIDN'T
 PARTICULARLY
 CARE! 
- "SHE
 WANTED
 US TO COLLECT
 THE
 MONEY!
 THERE
 THEY
 ARE!,"
 SHE
 LAUGHED
 CHEEKILY. 
- "WHAT'S
 THIS
 ALL
 ABOUT?,"
 I WONDERED,
 ALTHOUGH
 I HAD
 A GOOD IDEA
 WHAT
 IT WAS
 ALL
 ABOUT. 
- "WE MAY
 NOT
 TOUCH
 FELISTER
'S MONEY,
 BUT AT LEAST
 WE'LL
 SHRINK
 JAKE'S,"
 SHE
 LOOKED
 AT ME GRAVELY,
 WITHOUT
 A DROP
 OF SHA
ME. - "WAS
 COLLECTING
 HIS
 MONEY
 YOUR
 TOP
 PRIORITY?,"
 I STARTED
 TO QUESTION
 HER,
 "IS
 THAT
 THE
 MAIN
 THING
 THAT
 MATTERS? 
- "WITHOUT
 CASH
 WE CAN'T
 CONTINUE
 THE
 PARTY,"
 ZONARA
 REPLIED,
 "AND
 WE'RE
 ALREADY
 APPROACHING
 MISSOURI
 AND
 IT'S
 GOING
 TO GET
 PRETTY
 FUN
 THERE." 
102 
 I WAS
 AMAZED
 AT HOW
 EASILY
 HE USED
 THE
 WORD
 "FUN"
 IN HIS
 VOCABULARY.
 I'D
 HATE
 TO TALK
 TO HER. 
BUT WE BOTH
 HAD
 A COMMON
 GOAL
 - AND
 THAT
 WAS
 FELISTER. 

- "YOU'LL
 THANK
 ME LATER,
 I'M
 SURE,"
 SHE
 LAUGHED
 AGAIN.
 'THIS
 IS REAL
 LIFE,
 NOT
 SOME
 SIMULATION.
 HERE,
 NOW
 JAKE
 HAS
 GONE
 INTO
 OVERDRIVE! 
 
CHAPTER
 ELEVEN:
 ARLO 
 
GENERAL
 DENVER
 WAS
 TOO
 VARIED,
 AND HERE
 WE COULD
 FIND
 WHAT
 WE NEEDED.
 SO MANY
 PEOPLE
 GATHERED
 IN ONE
 PLACE. 
I IMMEDIATELY
 REMEMBERED
 THAT
 TWO
 OF THE
 MOST
 MASS
 SHOOTINGS
 IN MODERN
 AMERICAN
 HISTORY
 HAD OCCURRED
 IN THE
 STATE
 OF COLORADO.
 BUT
 THE
 BLOOD
 OF THE
 VICTIMS
 WAS
 STILL
 HERE,
 WHICH
 MADE
 ME THINK
 HOW
 HIGH
 SCHOOL
 CRIME
 WAS
 IN SOME
 STATES.
 IT HAD
 ALSO
 LED
 TO SO-CALLED
 ZERO
 TOLERANCE
 POLICIES
 IN SCHOOLS,
 WHICH
 MAINLY
 CONSISTED
 OF THE
 FACT
 THAT
 STUDENTS
 WERE
 NOT
 ALLOWED
 TO FREELY
 BRING
 GUNS
 INTO
 SCHOOL
 INSTITUTIONS
 - IN GENERAL,
 THIS
 EVENT
 HAD
 REVERBERATED
 AROUND
 THE
 WORLD
 AS WELL,
 AND
 ITS
 REVERBERATIONS
 WOULD
 NOT
 BE SILENCED
 FOR LONG.
 OVERALL,
 THERE
 WAS
 NO STRONG
 EVIDENCE
 THAT
 THIS
 INEVITABLY
 LED
 TO A DROP
 IN CRIME,
 BUT
 THESE
 POLICIES
 DID
 EXIST. 
ZONER
 AND
 I HAD
 BOTH
 COME
 TO TERMS
 WITH
 AND
 WERE
 LEFT
 WITH
 THE
 IMPRESSION
 THAT
 VIOLENCE
 WAS
 IN THE
 AIR
 IN THIS
 STATE. 
103 
 WHEN
 WE STOPPED
 ON A STRANGE
 LITTLE
 STREET,
 SEEMINGLY
 STUCK
 IN THE
 MIDDLE
 OF NOWHERE,
 I DECIDED
 TO ASK
 ZONARA
 QUITE
 CALMLY: 
- "WHERE
 ARE
 WE ACTUALLY
 GOING?,"
  I DECIDED
 TO PUT
 THE
 QUESTION
 TO HER
 DIRECTLY.
 "WE'VE
 LEFT
 SO MANY
 CORPSES
 ON OUR
 WAY
 HERE,
 AREN'T
 YOU
 GOING
 TO ELABORATE
 ON WHAT
 FELISTER
'S FAMOUS
 LEGACY
 ACTUALLY
 IS?
 AND
 MOST
 OF ALL,
 WHAT
 WILL
 BE MY USE
 OF THIS
 LEGACY
 ZONARA
 TURNED
 AWAY.
 LOOKED
 AT ME RATHER
 STRANGELY
 AND
 TURNED
 AWAY: 
- SOME
 THINGS
 IT IS BETTER
 NOT
 TO TALK
 ABOUT
 AT ALL.
 BUT
 I CAN
 PROMISE
 YOU
 THAT
 VERY
 SOON
 YOUR
 CURIOSITY
 WILL
 BE SATISFIED
 AND
 THE
 WHOLE
 PICTURE
 WILL
 BE
 SETTLED
 IN YOUR
 MIND.
 I AM ALMOST
 CERTAIN
 THAT
 YOU
 DID
 NOT
 EXPECT
 SUCH
 AN OUTCOME.
 HAVE
 YOU
 HEARD
 OF THE
 CHILDREN
 OF DEATH? 

I SHUDDERED
 TO HEAR
 HER
 UTTER
 SUCH
 A DREAD
 WORD
 WITH
 SEEMING
 LEVITY. 
- DO YOU
 KNOW
 THAT
 IN THE
 LEGISLATIVE
 SYSTEM
 OF SOME
 STATES
 THERE
 IS A LOOPHOLE
 BY WHICH
 A CRIMINAL
 CAN
 EASILY
 GET
 AWAY? 
I DIDN'T
 FULLY
 UNDERSTAND
 HER,
 BUT
 FOR
 THE
 FIRST
 TIME
 I COULD
 FEEL
 WHERE
 SHE
 WAS
 HITTING
 - SHE
 WAS
 A TRUE
 DEMON
 OF FLESH
 AND
 BLOOD.
 THAT
 WAS
 MY FIRST
 SIGNAL
 REACTION
 TO HER
 BEHAVIOR. 
HADN'T
 THE
 FE
 LEGACY
 BEEN
 WHAT
 WE'D
 SET
 OUT
 FOR,
 AND
 NOW
 IT HAD
 TURNED
 OUT
 TO BE SOMETHING
 COMPLETELY
 DIFFERENT!
 WHERE
 WAS
 THE
 TRUTH! 
104 
 - THE
 PROBLEM
 IS,
 TO COMPLETE
 THE
 RITUAL,
 WE'RE
 GOING
 TO NEED
 A RECRUIT
 WHO
 DOESN'T
 UNDERSTAND
 A SINGLE
 THING
 ABOUT
 MAGIC. 
I LEARNED!
 SHE
 WAS
 TALKING
 ABOUT
 THE
 RITUAL
 IN QUESTION
 FROM
 ABRAMELIN'S
 GRIMOIRE. 
- TELL
 ME MORE!
 I WANT
 TO KNOW
 EXACTLY
 WHAT
 I'M
 UP AGAINST!
 THIS
 WILL
 CHANGE
 THINGS
 A LOT!
 IT WILL
 GIVE
 ME A CHANCE
 TO UNDERSTAND... 
- "TO UNDERSTAND
 WHAT,"
 SHE
 ASKED
 ME WITH
 A STRANGE
 VEHEMENCE.
 - "TAKE
 A GOOD LOOK
 AROUND,
 WHAT
 THIS
 WORLD
 IS LIKE
 AND
 WHAT
 IT'S
 MADE
 OF! WHETHER
 THERE
 IS LOVE
 IN ITS
 CREATION,
 OR GRATITUDE
 TO TIP
 THE
 SCALES
 IN YOUR
 FAVOUR!
 CONSIDER
 WHETHER
 THOU
 THYSELF
 HAST
 NOT
 BEEN
 THE
 VICTIM
 OF SIMILAR
 CIRCUMSTANCES!" 
I FELT
 UNEASY.
 SHE
 WAS
 RIGHT.
 THERE
 WAS
 SOMETHING
 ABOUT
 THIS
 GIRL-SOMETHING
 REMINISCENT
 OF D105 
 - WRONG
 AGAIN.
 JAKE
 DECIDED
 TO KILL
 HIMSELF
 ONCE
 HE REALIZED
 HIS
 OWN
 ENVIRONMENT
 WAS
 TOXIC,
 AND
 HE WAS
 A VICTIM
 OF IT.
 ISN'T
 IT TRAGICOMIC
 THAT
 PEOPLE
 WHO
 SUPPOSEDLY
 HAVE
 EVERYTHING
 END
 UP WITH
 NOTHING?
 THE
 LAW
 OF REDISTRIBUTION
 IS TOO,
 TOO
 SIMPLE! 
- "EVEN IF WHAT
 YOU'
RE TELLING
 ME IS REALLY
 TRUE,"
 I LOOKED
 AT HER,
 FEELING
 A CERTAIN
 AMOUNT
 OF SKEPTICISM,
 "SOMETHING
 STILL
 DOESN'T
 ADD
 UP.
 THE
 MONEY
 IN THAT
 BAG
 PLUS
 JAKE'S
 MONEY
 IS ENOUGH
 TO DO A TRANSPLANT.
 YOU
 CAN
 PICK
 ANY CLINIC
 IN THE
 WHOLE
 WORLD
 AND
 YOU'LL
 PROBABLY
 BE ABLE
 TO COVER
 THE
 TREATMENT
 IN FULL
 - WITHOUT
 SERIOUS
 EFFORT.
 THERE
 ARE
 MANY
 DESTINATIONS
 WHERE
 THEY
 DO WONDERS
 LIKE
 THE
 US OR ISRAEL.
 WOULD
 YOU
 CONSIDER
 IT
 - THE
 PROBLEM
 IS THAT
 THE
 CELLS
 IN MY BODY
 ARE
 DAMAGED
 TO THE
 POINT
 WHERE
 HARDLY
 ANY
 CHEMOTHERA
PY WOULD
 BE OF ANY
 REAL
 BENEFIT.
 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
 YOU
 DON'T
 REALIZE
 ALL
 OF THIS.
 I WANT
 TO BEG
 FOR
 HELP
 NOT
 ONLY
 FOR
 MYSELF
 BUT
 FOR ALL
 THOSE
 KIDS
 WHO
 WERE
 IN THE
 BOARDING
 SCHOOL
 WITH
 YOU! 
- SO,
 FELISTER... 
- MAYBE
 YOU'RE
 BEGINNING
 TO REALIZE
 WHAT
 THIS
 WAS
 ALL
 ABOUT.
 FELISTER
 WAS
 A GREEDY
 TYPE
 WHO
 GOT
 A LOT
 BUT
 NEVER
 USED
 HIS
 VAST
 OPPORTUNITIES.
 WHERE
 OTHERS
 HUNG THEIR
 HEADS,
 HE WAS
 ON THE
 FRONT
 LINE.
 THE
 DEMONS
 PROVIDED
 PROTECTION
 FOR HIM
 TO ACHIEVE
 HIS
 GOAL
S. - AND
 WHAT
 EXACTLY
 WOULD
 YOU
 ASK
 OF A GUARDIAN
 ANGEL
 IF HE WAS
 AT ALL
 WILLING
 TO LISTEN
 AND
 HELP
 YOU! 
106 
 ZONARA
 SAID
 NOTHING,
 JUST
 TOOK
 MY HAND
 AND
 LOOKED
 AT ME WITH
 HIS
 DEEP,
 SAD,
 BLUE
 EYES. THAT
 LOOK
 COULD
 MELT
 YOU
 OR KILL
 YOU! 
- LOOK AROUND
 AT THE
 ENORMITY
 OF HUMAN
 SUFFERING!
 WE ARE
 HERE
 TO SUFFER
 - IT IS OUR
 VOCATION!
 WE ARE
 HERE
 TO LEARN
 OUR
 LESSON!
 BECAUSE
 THEN
 WE MAY
 NOT
 HAVE
 A CHANCE
 TO LIVE
 AGAIN! 

HER
 FACE
 WAS
 COVERED
 WITH
 TEARS
 AND
 I WANTED
 TO HUG HER,
 TO WRAP
 MY ARMS
 AROUND
 HER,
 TELLING
 HER
 I LOV
ED HER.
 CRUEL,
 IRRATIONAL,
 BRUTAL,
 UNPREDICTABLE,
 BUT
 MY LOVE! 
THEN
 I REMEMBERED
 EINSTEIN'S
 WORDS
 "IN
 THAT
 SENSE
 - I HAVE
 NEVER
 LOOKED
 UPON
 PEACE
 AND
 HAPPINESS
 AS ENDS
 IN THEMSELVES
 - SUCH
 AN ETHICAL
 BASE
 I WOULD
 DEFINE
 AS MORE
 SUITED
 TO A HERD
 OF PIGS.
5" 
- YES, THAT
 WAS
 FELISTER
'S HIDDEN
 AGENDA!
 TO SHOW
 US THAT
 WE WERE
 LIKE
 A HERD
 OF SWINE!
 BUT
 I WANT
 TO LIVE! 
- "THEN,
 IF WE ARE
 TO TAKE
 THE
 INDIAN'S
 WORD
 FOR IT,
 WHAT
 IS IT THAT
 SO HAUNTS
 US- I PUZZLED
 GRAVELY-
"THE
 SPIRITS
 BURNED
 WITH
 NO DESIRE
 TO SHARE
 THEIR
 KNOWLEDGE
 WITH
 HER,
 AND
 THIS
 SEEMED
 TO ME A LITTLE
 STRANGE." 
- "THE
 INDIAN
 MAGIC
 IS TOO STRONG,"
 INTERJECTED
 ZONARA,
 "IT HAS
 HAUNTED
 US ALL
 THE
 WAY
 HERE!
 THIS
 POWER,
 IT'S
 IN ME AND
 IT MAKES
 ME FEEL
 IT!" 
- DON'T
 YOU
 REMEMBER
 THAT
 FELISTER
 STARTED
 HIS
 RITUAL
 WITH
 ME FIRST,
 BECAUSE
 HE COULDN'T
 FIND
 A                                                
 5   From "How I See the World", a collection of essays and l
etters 
by the genius Albert Einstein 
107 
 BOY,
 OR RATHER
 HE COULDN'T
 FIND
 A SUITABLE
 BOY
 THAT
 FIT THE
 CRITERIA! 
- "WELL,
 IN THAT
 CASE,
 WHY
 SHOULDN'T
 I BE THAT
 BOY,"
 I INTERJECTED,
 "IT'S
 NOT
 SOME
 GAME,
 IT'S
 SOMETHING
 THAT
 CAN
 SAVE
 YOU! 
- "YOU
 DON'T
 NEED
 TO SACRIFICE
 YOURSELF
 FOR
 MY SAKE,"
 SHE
 TOLD
 ME SERIOUSLY,
 "I'M
 HERE
 AND
 MAYBE
 THAT'S
 THE
 WAY
 IT SHOULD
 BE.
 I SHALL
 BEAR
 MY OWN
 CROSS,
 AND
 THAT
 MUST
 NOT
 BE YOUR
 RESPONSIBILITY." 

- WELL
 THEN,
 WHY
 DON'T
 WE JUST
 GO TO ONE
 OF THOSE
 JOLLY
 SHOPS
6 . 
THE
 TWO
 OF US DID
 VISIT
 SUCH
 A PLACE
 AND
 THERE
 WERE
 QUITE
 A FEW
 UNINITIATED
 TEENAGERS
 WONDERING
 WHAT
 STRAIN
 OF MARIJUANA
 WOULD
 BE BEST
 SUITED
 TO THEIR
 SOPHISTICATED
 TASTES.
 I GUESSED
 A BIT,
 BUT
 GENERALLY
 TOOK
 THE
 POSSIBILITY
 OF SUCH
 A SOCIAL
 EXPERIMENT
 IN STRIDE. 
I KNEW
 THAT
 MARIJUANA
 CONTAINED
 THE
 ACTIVE
 SUBSTANCE
 TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL,
 BUT
 I ALSO
 KNEW
 THAT
 EXCESSIVE
 USE
 COULD
 LEAD
 TO A HEART
 ATTACK.
 I LEFT
 THESE
 LOST
 SOULS
 IN THIS
 SMOKY
 WORLD
 THAT
 WAS
 THEIR
 WAY
 OF ESCAPING
 REALITY. 
WHEN
 WE WERE
 GOING
 OUT THERE
 WAS
 A STRANGE
 GUY
 CALLED
 BLUEBIRD. 
I THOUGHT
 THAT
 THIS
 YOUNG
 MAN,
 AND
 HE LOOKED
 MORE
 LIKE
 AN ADULT,
 HAD
 HAD
 A GOOD HARD
 SMOKE
 AND
 WAS
 GETTING
 INTO
 CHARACTER,
 BUT
 IN FACT
 WE HAD
 COME
 ACROSS
 A MAN
 WITH
 WHOM
 OUR
 ADVENTURE
 WAS
 JUST
 ABOUT
 TO BEGIN.
 HE TOLD US                                                
 6  Jolly shops in the state of Colorado have been linked
 to the 
legal sale of marijuana, the first state to introduce su
ch a 
measure. 
108 
 MANY
 INTERESTING
 AND
 USEFUL
 THINGS
 - AND
 FOR FREE.
 APPARENTLY
 HE ALSO
 FELT
 A BIT
 AWKWARD
 IN A PLACE
 LIKE
 THIS. 
- "I
 HAVE
 SOMETHING
 FOR
 YOU.
 I WANT
 TO SHOW
 YOU
 SOMETHING,"
 HE REMARKED.
 "GRASS
 IS NOT
 IMPORTANT,
 AND
 YOU
 ARE
 INTERESTED
 IN SOMETHING
 QUI
TE DIFFERENT." 
LEAVING
 THE
 CITY
 LIMITS,
 WE CAME
 UPON
 A COUNTRY
 ROAD
 THAT
 PROBABLY
 LED
 TO NOWHERE. 
- "I
 UNDERSTAND
 YOU'VE
 BEEN
 TO SEE A WOMAN
 SHAMAN,"
 HE LAUGHED,
 "AND
 SHE
 HASN'T
 REVEALED
 A WORD
 TO YOU,
 HAS
 SHE?
 I'M
 SURE
 IT'S
 ALL
 PLAIN
 AS DAY.
 YOU
 SPECIAL
 AND
 I HELPED
 YOU." 
HE WAS
 SLURRING
 HIS
 WORDS
 SO STRANGELY
 THAT
 I WONDERED
 WHAT
 ETHNIC
 GROUP
 OF INDIANS
 HE WAS.
 HE SEEMED TO GUESS
 MY THOUGHTS
 AND
 HASTENED
 TO REPLY: 
- I AM FROM
 THE
 CAYUGA
7 TRIBE
 AND
 I CAN
 TELL
 YOU
 FOR A FACT
 THAT
 THAT
 SHAMAN
 DID
 NOT
 REVEAL
 TO YOU
 EVEN AS MUCH
 AS A PEA
 EXACTLY
 WHAT
 HAPPENED.
 AND
 THE
 NATURE
 OF THE
 CURSE
 THAT
 IS UPON
 YOU!
 FOR
 A START
 I CAN
 INFORM
 THE
 HONOURABLE
 LADY
 THAT
 SHE
 IS NOT
 A CANCER
 PATIENT
 AS SHE
 THINKS.
 AND
 PROBABLY
 NEVER
 WAS!
 AND
 PROBABLY
 NEVER
 WILL
 BE! 
ZONARA
 SHRIEKED
 AND
 COVERED
 HER
 FACE
 WITH
 HER
 HANDS. 

- BUT NOT
 ONLY
 THAT!
 THE
 SACRED
 PLACE
 WHERE
 YOU
 SHOULD
 REALLY
 PERFORM
 THE
 RITUAL
 IS LA POINTE
 CEMETERY,
 WHICH
 IS LOCATED
 IN WISCONSIN. 
                                               
 7 One of the five main tribes of the Iroquois League. 
109 
 - RIGHT
 BETWEEN
 MISSOURI
 AND
 OHIO
 - WE BOTH
 ROARED
 IN UNISON. 
- "BACK
 IN THE
 DAY
," BLUEBIRD
 BEGAN,
 "THERE
 WERE
 MAJOR
 PROBLEMS
 AND
 DISORGANIZATIONS
 WITH
 THE
 RECOGNITION
 OF SACRED
 INDIAN
 SITES.
 FOR US IT IS A SPECIFIC
 AND
 DISCREET
 PLACE
 THAT
 CAN BE IDENTIFIED
 WITH
 OUR
 BELIEFS.
 OF COURSE,
 THERE
 ARE
 ENOUGH
 SUCH
 PLACES
 IN THE
 US,
 BUT
 LA POINTE
 IS DIFFERENT
 ENOUGH
 IN THIS
 RESPECT."
 "LOOK,"
 HE PAUSED,
 "IMAGINE
 ALL
 THE
 PARANORMAL
 ACTIVITY
 THAT
 IS OFTEN
 THE
 SUBJECT
 OF SPECULATION.
 THERE
 ARE
 CHRISTIANS
 BURIED
 IN THIS
 PLACE.
 AND
 THAT
 IS WHAT
 MAKES
 IT UNIQUE.
 IF YOU
 PLAY
 YOUR
 CARDS
 RIGHT,
 YOU
 WILL
 BE ABLE
 TO COMPLETE
 YOUR
 RITUAL,
 BUT AFTER
 THAT,
 A LOT
 OF DANGERS
 AWAIT
 YOU." 
A BLUE
 BIRD
 TURNED
 AND
 WHILE
 BLINKING
 WAS
 GONE.
 WHO
 KNOWS
 WHY
 THIS
 FOCUS
 IMPRESSED
 ME MORE
 THAN
 HIS
 RATHER
 INTERESTING
 WORDS. 
IT TOOK
 US MORE
 THAN
 THREE
 HOURS
 TO WALK
 BACK
 TO THAT SAME
 DENVER
 ESTABLISHMENT
 - BUT
 TO OUR
 SURPRISE
 IT WAS
 STILL
 FULL
 OF PEOPLE! 
BOTH
 ZONARA
 AND
 I HAD
 STRETCHED
 A FEW
 CACHACAS
 OF A RARE
 DUTCH
 HEMP
 VARIETY,
 BUT OUR
 THOUGHTS
 WERE
 AS CRYSTAL
 CLEAR
 AS THEY
 COULD
 NOT
 HAVE
 BEEN
 UNDER
 OTHER
 CIRCUMSTANCES.
 I HAD
 THE
 FEELING
 THAT
 I WAS
 PRACTICING
 AS A NOVICE
 MAGICIAN
 TO SEE SOME
 OBJECT
 IN MAGIC
 CRYSTAL.
 BY THE
 WAY,
 THE
 METHODS
 FOR PROJECTING
 VISUALIZATION
 WERE
 EXACTLY
 IDENTICAL
 TO THOSE
 FOR PROJECTING
 EMOTION. 
- "THAT'S
 THE
 KEY!,"
 I SHOUTED.
 "FELISTER
'S REAL
 POINT.
 YES,
 MAYBE
 LA POINTE
 IS THE
 PLACE
 FOR THE
 RITUAL,
 BUT
 SURELY
 WE NEED
 TO PROJECT
 THE
 RIGHT
 EMOTION
 TO SEE
 THE
 REST." 
110 
 - "WHAT
 IS THIS
 SIMPLICITY?,"
 SNIFFED
 ZONARA.
 "YES,
 WISCONSIN
 IS INDEED
 LOCATED
 BETWEEN
 MISSOURI
 AND
 OHIO,
 BUT
 THERE
 WAS
 ONE
 MORE
 CLARIFICATION
 IN THE
 INSTRUCTIONS
 FOR
 FINDING
 THE
 INHERITANCE." 
- "THAT'S
 WHAT
 I'M
 TALKING
 ABOUT,"
 I ADDED.
 "REMEMBER
 THE
 MESSAGE
 FELISTER
 FORMULATED.
 - "WHOEVER
 FINDS
 THE
 INHERITANCE
 WILL
 ALSO
 INHERIT
 MY SORROW.
 HE WHO
 FACES
 DEATH
 WILL
 REALIZE
 HIS
 INNER
 STRENGTH.
 AND
 HE WHO
 GOES
 AGAINST
 THE
 WILL
 OF THE
 GODS
 WILL
 SUFFER!" 
- "SO SURELY
 THE
 PLACE
 IS LA POINTE,
 BUT
 FOR ALL
 I KNOW
 THERE
 ARE
 VANDALS
 THERE
 WHO
 COULD
 PROVE
 DANGEROUS.
 IT WOULD
 BE EXTREMELY
 UNPLEASANT
 IF WE WERE
 INTERRUPTED
 IN THE
 MIDDLE
 OF THE
 RITUAL,"
 ZONARA
 CALLED
 IN ANNOYANCE. 
- "THIS
 MEANS
 THAT
 THE
 LA POINTE
 CEMETERY
 ITSELF
 IS NOT
 PURELY
 INDIAN,
 AS THE
 REMAINS
 OF MANY
 OTHER
 ETHNIC
 GROUPS
 ARE
 ALSO
 LAID
 THERE,"
 I INTERJECTED,
 "FROM
 WHAT
 I HAVE
 HEARD,
 SOME
 OF THE
 INDIAN
 GRAVES
 ARE
 PROTECTED
 BY WHAT
 IS CALLED
 A 'SPIRIT
 HOUSE'
 TO PROTECT
 THE
 DECEASED." 
- "BUT
 BLUEBIRD
 HASN'T
 REVEALED
 WHO
 THIS
 DEMON
 IS THAT
 IS SO ACTIVELY
 STALKING
 US?,"
 I SOMEWHAT
 ODDLY
 CHALLENGED
 ZONARA. 
- NOR
 IS IT NECESSARY!
 WE MAY
 FIND
 THE
 ANSWER
 TO THAT
 QUESTION
 OURSELVES! 
- "HE WHO
 HAS
 LEFT
 THE
 CHILDREN'S
 WORLD
 OF YURAS
8 SUFFERS,"
 I SADLY
 REPLIED.
 "DISTANT
 JOURNEYS
 INTO
 THE
 ASTRAL
 WORLDS
 ARE
 NOT
 FOR
                                                
 8  In the book "Traces of Souls", Michael Newton describes this 
first level as the place where souls are born and their e
nergy is 
infused. It is also where their spirit guides are who g
uide them. 
111 
 EVERYONE.
 IN A STATE
 OF SLEEP
 PARALYSIS
 ONE
 CAN
 REACH
 THE
 DIFFERENT
 LEVELS
 OF THE
 ASTRAL." 
- "WE HAVE
 TO GO,"
 ZONARA
 LOOKED
 AT ME, NOT
 WITH
 A DREAMY
 LOOK,
 BUT
 RATHER
 WITH
 A MELANCHOLIC
 ONE
 THAT
 I JUST
 COULDN'T
 BEAR,
 "THIS
 IS THE
 WAY
 WE HAVE
 TO GO! WE ARE
 COMPANIONS
 IN THIS
 WORLD,
 REMEMBER?
 WE SHALL
 FIND
 THE
 TRUE
 HERITAGE
 OF FELISTER,
 AND
 BE HAPPY-TOGETHER!
 TWO
 SOULS!" 
I SEEMED TO BREAK
 FROM
 MY NUMBNESS.
 SHE
 KNEW
 WELL
 ENOUGH
 WHAT
 SHE
 WAS
 SAYING
 TO ME! 
WE DECIDED
 TO ASK
 THE
 GUESTS
 OF THE
 ESTABLISHMENT
 JUST
 WHERE
 BLUEBIRD
 - THE
 GOOD-
NATURED
 INDIAN
 - LIVED. 
AFTER
 WE HAD
 SPENT
 SOME
 TIME
 AMONG
 THESE
 STONED
 GRASSMEN
 ONE
 OF THEM
 VENTURED
 TO DECLARE
 WITH
 HALF
 A MOUTH 
- HE COMES
 AND
 GOES
 AS HE PLEASES.
 HE IS AT ONCE
 EVERYWHERE
 AND
 NOWHERE.
 AND
 NONE
 OF US KNOW
 EXACTLY
 WHERE
 HE IS FROM,
 BUT
 WE HAVE
 HEARD
 THAT
 HE SPENDS
 SOME
 TIME
 ON AN INDIAN
 RESERVATION-
 NOT
 FAR
 FROM
  HERE,
 SOMEONE
 TUGGED
 ON HIS
 ARM
 AND
 HE WAS
 BACK
 IN THE
 EUPHORIC
 GROUP
 OF OVERZEALOUS
 HIPPIES
 WHO
 COULD
 HARDLY
 GET
 OUT
 OF THEIR
 HEDONISTIC
 LIFESTYLE! 
HOWEVER,
 AFTER
 A WHILE
 HE CAME
 BACK
 TO US AND
 SAID
 SERIOUSLY: 
- BLUEBIRD
 IS ABLE
 TO TRAVEL
 BETWEEN
 WORLDS.
 HOW
 HE KNOWS,
 BUT SOMETIMES
 RECRUITS
 DISCIPLES
 WHOM
 HE IS WILLING
 TO TRAIN.
 I BELIEVE
 THE
 MENOMINEE
 INDIAN
 RESERVATION,
 LOCATED
 IN NORTHEASTERN
 WISCONSIN,
 IS WHERE
 HE RESIDES.
 BY THE
 WAY,
 HIS
 TERRITORY
 IS QUITE
 LARGE,
 BUT NOT
 112 
 THAT
 MANY
 PEOPLE
 LIVE
 THERE
 - MAYBE
 UNDER
 FOUR
 THOUSAND,
 SO YOU'LL
 FIND
 HIM
 FOR SURE! 
THE
 NAMELESS
 HIPPAR
 THEN
 LEFT
 THE
 JOLLY
 SHOP. 
THE
 ROAD
 FROM
 DENVER
 TO WISCONSIN
 WAS
 NOT
 THE
 MOST
 PLEASANT,
 BUT
 NOW
 THE
 ZONAR
 AND
 I WERE
 MUCH
 CLOSER.
 AND
 MOST UNEXPECTEDLY
 THE
 HIPPO
9 DECIDED
 TO JOIN
 US BY SAYING: 
- I'M
 FOND
 OF THE
 MOST
 OUTLANDISH
 ADVENTURES
 IMAGINABLE,
 AND
 I HAVE
 A FEELING
 YOU
 KNOW
 WHERE
 YOU'RE
 GOING,
 AND
 I'M
 ASKING
 YOU
 TO TAKE
 ME WITH
 YOU.
 I THINK
 I WILL
 HELP
 YOU
 TO FIND
 MORE
 EASILY
 THE
 MENOMINEE
 RESERVE,
 WHERE
 THE
 BLUEBIRD
 IS MOST
 LIKELY
 TO BE FOUND,
 AND
 PERHAPS
 THE
 THREE
 OF US CAN
 BE HIS
 APPRENTICES
 TO MASTER
 THE
 SKILL
 OF TRAVELING
 THROUGH
 THE
 ASTRAL
 WORLD.
 KNOW
 THAT
 ONE
 OF THE
 POSSIBLE
 DANGERS
 IS THE
 IMPOSSIBILITY
 OF RETURNING
 TO THE
 SOUL'S
 PHYSICAL
 BODY,
 BUT
 THIS
 IS KNOWN
 TO EVERY
 RECRUIT,
 SO I'M
 HARDLY
 TELLING
 YOU
 ANYTHING
 NEW.
 BUT GETTING
 TO THE
 ASTRAL
 IS A MUCH
 MORE
 DIFFICULT
 THING
 THAN
 RETURNING.
 THE
 FAMOUS
 SILVER
 THREAD
 CONNECTS
 THE
 SOUL
 AND
 THE
 BODY,
 AND
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND
 THERE
 IS ANOTHER
 PROBLEM,
 NAMELY
 THE
 FEELING
 OF THE
 PASSAGE
 OF TIME
 IN THIS
 OTHER
 AND
 DIFFERENT
 DIMENSION,
 WHICH
 HAS
 NOTHING
 TO DO WITH
 THE
 TIME
 THAT
 PASSES
 WITH
 US.
 AND
 THE
 BEST
 PART
 IS THAT
 GETTING
 PHYSICALLY
 HARMED
 IN THE
 ASTRAL
 IS NOT
 VERY
 LIKELY.
 BUT
 THERE
 ARE
 CERTAIN
 ASTRAL
 CREATURES
 THAT
 FEED
 ON HUMAN
 ENERGY
 THAT
 WILL
 DRINK
 FROM
 US. 
GOING
 TO THE
 PRESERVE
 WAS
 VERY
 SPECIAL
 FOR ZONARA,
 WHO
 DEEP
 DOWN
 WAS
 BEGINNING
 TO BELIEVE
 BLUEBIRD,
 WHO
 HAD
 STATED
 THAT
 THE
 PLACE
 FOR THE

counterculture in the United States in the 1960s. 
113 
 RITUAL
 WAS
 THE
 LA POINTE
 CEMETERY
 BECAUSE
 OF
 ITS
 SPECIAL
 ENERGY,
 BUT
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND
 THERE
 WAS
 SOME
 DOUBT
 THAT
 NOT
 EVERYTHING
 HAD
 BEEN
 FINISHED.
 HOW
 MUCH
 SHE
 HAD
 INVESTED
 IN THE
 HOPE
 OF DISCOVERING
 FELISTER
'S LEGACY
 - THAT
 WHICH
 HER
 SOUL
 CRAVED
 AND
 HER
 BODY
 LONGED
 FOR.
 TO RECEIVE
 THAT
 RIGHT
 OF CLEANSING
 FROM
 HER
 SINS
 WHICH
 SHE
 FELT
 SHE
 DESERVED. 
ARLO
 - THAT
 WAS
 THE
 NAME
 OF THE
 HIPSTE
R, HAD
 A COMPLETELY
 DIFFERENT
 OPINION
 ON THE
 MATTER.
 IN GENERAL,
 THE
 HIPPIE
 MOVEMENT
 WAS
 BASED
 ON FIGHTING
 CONFORMITY,
 AND
 THAT
 WAS
 NOT
 TO BE IGNORED.
 IF CONFORMISTS
 LIKED
 TO BE PART
 OF THE
 HERD,
 THE
 REPRESENTATIVES
 OF THE
 HIPPIE
 MOVEMENT
 DID
 NOT
 SUFFER
 FROM
 SUCH
 SCRUPLES. 
- SOME
 REPRESENT
 DIFFERENT
 IDEOLOGIES,
 BUT
 I LIKE
 BEING
 PART
 OF THE
 WOLF
 BRIGADE
10, WHICH
 OBEYS
 ITS
 OWN
 RULES
 IN ITS
 SURVIVAL.
 MOST
 HIPPARI'S
 HAVE
 TURNED
 TO HINDUISM,
 OR BUDDHISM,
 BUT
 FRANKLY
 I AM STILL
 SEARCHING
 FOR
 ANSWERS
 FOR MYSELF. 
- "OUR
 SOCIETY
 IS SICK,"
 ZONARA
 AGREED,
 "BUT
 THIS
 IS ONLY
 THE
 SURFACE
 OF THE
 ICEBERG,
 AND
 IT IS BOILING
 AND
 SEETHING
 UNDERNEATH." 
WE DECIDED
 THAT
 WE COULD
 HEAD
 TO WISCONSIN
 AT DAWN,
 AS ARLO
 WAS
 KEEN
 TO HAVE
 SOME
 MORE
 OF THE
 EXCELLENT
 DUTCH
 CACHA114 
 TOES.
 IT'S
 ONLY
 FOR TRUE
 CONNOISSEURS,
 BUT
 NOT
 FOR PROFANE!" 
- "ACCORDING
 TO SOME,
 THERE
 ARE
 SEVEN ASTRAL
 WORLDS,"
 I OBJECTED,
 "BUT
 SOME
 SAY
 THERE
 ARE
 NINE,
 AND
 OTHERS
 SIMPLY
 SAY
 NOTHING
 ABOUT
 IT!" 
- "A
 BLUEBIRD
 IS THE
 RIGHT
 MAN
 AND
 YOUR
 GUIDE
 ON THE
 WAY,"
 THOUGHT
 ARLO.
 "WE MUST
 GET
 TO THE
 RESERVE
 AN HOUR
 SOONER,
 FOR THERE
 IS A GOOD DEAL
 OF DISORDER
 THERE,
 AND
 WE MAY
 NOT
 CATCH
 HIM.
 HE'S
 ALWAYS
 TRAVELLING
 ABOUT
 HIS
 OWN
 BUSINESS." 

THE
 ROAD
 FROM
 COLORADO
 TO WISCONSIN
 WAS
 OVER
 A THOUSAND
 AND
 A HUNDRED
 MILES,
 WHICH
 MEANT
 THAT
 WE WOULD
 BE THERE
 AT LEAST
 SIXTEEN
 OR SEVENTEEN
 HOURS,
 IF NOT
 MORE. 
ARLO
 SUGGESTED
 THAT
 WE HITCHHIKE,
 NOT
 ONLY
 BECAUSE
 HE THOUGHT
 THAT
 WAY
 WAS
 RATHER
 ROMANTIC,
 BUT
 ALSO
 BECAUSE
 IT WOULD
 NOT
 ATTRACT
 UNDUE ATTENTION. 
BEFORE
 WE LEFT,
 HOWEVER,
 HE EXPRESSED
 A DESIRE
 TO TELL
 US A FEW
 WORDS
 ABOUT
 HIMSELF.
 WE AGREED
 OUT
 OF COURTESY
 AND
 LISTENED
 TO HIS
 BRIEF
 INTRODUCTION. 

- SEE, I'VE
 LIVED
 OUTSIDE
 SOCIETY
 ALL
 MY LIFE
 - WE HIPSTERS
 WERE
 PART
 OF A FADING
 MOVEMENT
 THAT
 GENERALLY
 LIVED
 IN AN ALTERNATE
 UNIVERSE.
 BUT I CAN
 CLEARLY
 SEE THAT
 YOU
 HAVE
 A CAUSE
 THAT
 BECOMES
 MINE
 AS WELL,
 AND
 I WILL
 HELP
 YOU
 GET
 TO THE
 TRUTH.
 I HOPE
 BLUEBIRD
 GIVES
 YOU
 WHAT
 YOU
 NEED.

 CHAPTER
 TWELVE:
 GUS
 BENZOUR 
 
WE WERE
 TRAVELING
 ON HIGHWAY
 EIGHTY
 AND
 THERE
 WE COULD
 CLEARLY
 SEE THE
 HEAVY
 TRAFFIC
 FROM
 CITIES
 LIKE
 SACRAMENTO
 AND
 AUCKLAND.
 WE ALSO
 HAD
 TO CROSS
 THE
 STATES
 OF NEBRASKA
 AND
 IOWA.
 AS WE TRAVELED,
 SOMEWHERE
 IN THE
 DISTANCE
 I GLIMPSED
 SMALL
 HOUSES
 SET
 IN AN ENDLESS
 FIELD
 DRAWING
 ELECTRICITY
 FROM
 WIND
 TURBINES.
 YES,
 THE
 WIND
 WAS
 THAT
 LIBERATING
 FORCE!
 THE
 RURAL IDYLL
 OF THE
 MIDDLE
 STATES
 WAS
 NOT
 TO BE UNDERESTIMATED
 - ESPECIALLY
 SINCE
 MANY
 PEOPLE
 WERE
 FORCED
 TO SURVIVE
 IN NEAR
 TOTAL
 SOLITUDE
 AND
 SOCIAL
 ISOLATION.
 BUT
 THEN
 AGAIN,
 EVERY
 ONE
 OF THOSE
 VILLAGERS
 HAD
 GUNS
 IN ABUNDANCE.
 BASS
 INSISTED
 THAT,
 IN ADDITION
 TO GUNS,
 THEY
 HAD
 AT LEAST
 ONE
 "WINCHESTER"
 HANDY. 
THE
 DUDE WHO
 DROVE
 US WAS
 A SERIOUS
 PLANT
 TECHNICIAN
 WHO
 WAS
 GOING
 TO SOME
 AGRICULTURAL
 SHOW
 IN IOWA
 STATE,
 WHICH
 HAD
 ITS ADVANTAGES,
 BUT HE PROMISED
 TO HELP
 US ORGANIZE
 OUR
 TRANSPORTATION
 FURTHER.
 HIS
 PHYSIQUE
 WAS
 RELATIVELY
 LARGE
 AND HE WAS
 OVER
 ONE-EIGHTY
 TALL,
 WITH
 BROAD
 ENOUGH
 SHOULDERS
 TO IMPRESS
 THE
 LADIES
 HE WAS
 MOST
 LIKELY
 HITTING
 ON AT THE
 VARIOUS
 EVENTS.
 NOT
 THAT
 HE WAS
 A BAD
 GUY,
 AND
 HE WAS
 A CASUAL
 WHISTLER
 WITH
 HIS
 MOUTH! 
HIS
 NAME
 WAS
 GUS,
 AND
 INWARDLY
 I THOUGHT
 HE WAS
 IN ON OUR
 IDEA
 OF HITCHHIKING.
 WHY
 AND
 WHY
 NOT!
 TOLD
 US HOW
 HE HAD
 WANTED
 TO DO THE
 SAME
 THING
 ALL
 HIS
 LIFE
 - ESPECIALLY
 WHEN
 HE WAS
 YOUNGER,
 BUT COINCIDENTALLY
 HADN'T
 BEEN
 ABLE
 TO. 
DECIDED
 TO GIVE
 US A SHORT
 LECTURE
 AND
 DEFINITELY
 WHAT
 HE TOLD
 US HELPED
 US IN OUR
 FURTHER
 QUEST: 
116 
 - CORN
 WAS
 REVERED
 BY THE
 INDIANS
 AS A SYMBOL
 OF LIFE
 ITSELF!
 AH,
 WE STOMP
 IT WITH
 OUR
 FEET! 
HE LAUGHED
 SOMEWHAT
 SOURLY,
 BUT
 CONTINUED
 TO WATCH
 THE
 ROAD
 AHEAD,
 DRIVING
 MOST
 CAREFULLY.
 THERE
 WEREN'T
 TOO MANY
 VEHICLES
 ON THE
 ROAD
 AROUND
 US,
 BECAUSE
 SOMEHOW
 GUS
 MANAGED
 TO AVOID
 THEM
 AND
 KEEP
 A DISTANCE
 THAT
 WOULD
 HAVE
 PREVENTED
 A MORE
 SERIOUS
 ACCIDENT. 
HIS
 RED
 PICKUP
 LOOKED
 BRAND
 NEW
 AND
 GLEAMED
 IN THE
 CHEERFUL
 SUN
 THAT
 SHONE
 FROM
 ABOVE
 - THOUGH
 SOMEHOW
 TOO DISTANT. 
- THERE'S
 TOO MUCH
 SYMBOLISM
 IN THIS
 LIFE,"
 HE SAID,
 TAKING
 A DRAG
 FROM
 A CIGARETTE
 THAT
 HE SOMEHOW
 MANAGED
 TO HOLD
 ON TO WHILE
 HE DRANK,
 "FOR
 INSTANCE,
 THIS
 PARTICULAR
 STATE
 WAS
 ONCE
 A DESERT,
 AND
 NOW
 IT'S
 ONE
 OF THE
 MOST
 AGRICULTURALLY
 DEVELOPED.
 AND
 THE
 OGALLALA
 RESERVOIR
 PROVIDES
 WATER
 FOR
 THE
 ENTIRE
 STATE.
 BUT YOU
 WANT
 TO SEE WHAT'S
 BEYOND,
 DON'T
 YOU? 
AFTER
 A BRIEF
 REFLECTION,
 HE DECIDED
 THAT
 HE MIGHT
 AS WELL
 COME
 WITH
 US TO AYOWA,
 WHERE
 THERE
 WERE
 A VARIETY
 OF AGRICULTURAL
 COMPETITIONS,
 WHERE
 HE DECIDED
 TO TEST
 HIS
 SKILLS.
 OF COURSE
 THAT
 WOULD
 HAVE
 SLOWED
 US DOWN
 A BIT,
 OR SO I THOUGHT,
 BUT
 THEN
 AGAIN,
 EXPERIENCE
 HAD
 TOLD
 ME SO FAR
 THAT
 NO PART
 OF
 OUR
 ODYSSEY
 WAS
 THE
 RESULT
 OF CHANCE,
 BUT
 OF A MUCH
 DEEPER
 DESIGN. 
- "IN FAIRFIELD
 THEY
 DO THESE
 ODDITIES,"
 HE CALLED,
 IN THE
 TYPICAL
 MIDDLE
 STATES
 DRAWL,
 "IT WILL
 CERTAINLY
 BE INTERESTING
 THERE!" 
ON THE
 WAY,
 ARLO
 KEPT
 UP HIS
 WITTICISMS,
 BUT ONLY
 ENOUGH
 TO LIFT
 OUR
 SPIRITS.
 IT OCCURRED
 TO ME THAT
 THE
 ENTIRE
 HIPSTER
 SUBCULTURE
 WAS
 BUILT
 ON 117 
 THE
 PRINCIPLE
 OF BELONGING
 TO NO ONE,
 ANYWHERE.
 THAT'S
 EXACTLY
 HOW
 I FELT
 AT THAT
 MOMENT. 
IT'S
 STRANGE
 HOW
 ONE
 TRIES
 TO EXTRAPOLATE
 SUCH
 FEELINGS
 EVEN WHEN
 THEY
 DON'T
 CORRESPOND
 TO REALITY. 

A SIOUX
 THOUGHT
 CAME
 TO MY MIND
 THAT
 FROM
 WAKAN
 TANKA
 COMES
 ALL
 POWER.
 THEN
 WHERE
 DID
 THE
 POWER
 OF A FELISTER
 COME
 FROM,
 AROUND
 WHOM
 SO MANY
 DESTINIES
 WERE
 INTERTWINED?
 SO STRANGE
 A CIRCLE
 WAS
 THERE
 IN THIS
 LIFE
 THAT
 SIMPLY
 CREATED
 ITS
 BEAUTY,
 BUT
 WHAT
 WAS
 THERE
 BEYOND
 IT,
 AND
 WAS
 THERE
 ANYTHING
 BEYOND
 AT ALL? 

IT WAS
 HERE
 IN NEBRASKA
 THAT
 A FENTANYL
 INJECTION
 EXECUTION
 WAS
 CARRIED
 OUT,
 AND
 IT DIDN'T
 TAKE
 LONG
 FOR ME TO REMEMBER
 THAT
 FELISTER
 HAD
 ALSO
 MANAGED
 TO FIND
 A PRETTY
 GOOD
 USE
 FOR FENTANYL
 - ONLY
 FOR
 OTHER
 PURPOSES
 - AND
 ON A GRAND
 SCALE. 
THE
 FURTHER
 WE WENT,
 I COULD
 SENSE
 THAT
 THE
 PEOPLE
 I WAS
 MOVING
 WITH
 WERE
 NOT
 RANDOM
 AND
 EACH
 WAS
 DRIVEN
 BY PERSONAL
 MOTIVES
 TO DISCOVER
 THE
 TRUTH
 ABOUT
 THEMSELVES.
 AND
 THAT
 TRUTH
 COULD
 PROVE
 TO BE TOO
 DANGEROUS! 
ONCE
 WE REACHED
 OUR
 FINAL
 DESTINATION,
 WHERE
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 HAD
 TO LEAVE
 SOME
 HOUSEKEEPING
 ORDERS,
 HE DECIDED
 TO SHOW
 US SOMETHING
 ELSE.
 I FELT
 IN MY HEART
 THAT
 IT WAS
 GOING
 TO BE VITAL
 IN GETTING
 US TO THE
 RESERVE! 
- "YOU
 KNOW?,"
 HE TURNED
 TO US,
 "I DON'T
 THINK
 THERE'S
 A SINGLE

 KNOW
 WHAT
 TEMASCAL

 118 
 - "YOU

 OFF

 SUBSEQUENTLY

 WAS

- RESERVES
 ARE
 ONLY
 A TEMPORARY
 SOLUTION.
 WHAT
 WILL
 A PERSON
 DO WHO
 DOESN'T
 BELONG
 ANYWHERE?
 WHERE
 WILL
 HE GO? THEIR
 ORIGINAL
 INTENT
 DEGENERATED,
 AND
 BLUEBIRD... 
121 
 - "A
 BLUE
 BIRD?
 SO YOU
 KNOW
 HIM!,"
 EXCLAIMED
 ARLO
 EXCITEDLY,
 "YOU
 MUST
 BE AWARE
 OF HIS
 ABILITIES." 
GUS
 DID
 NOT
 REPLY.
 HE ONLY
 TOOK A THOUGHTFUL
 DRAG
 FROM
 HIS
 CIGARETTE.
 THE
 SMOKE
 FORMED
 STRANGE
 SHAPES
 IN THE
 AIR
 THAT
 LOOKED
 TO ME AS IF THEY
 HAD
 MAGICAL
 SIGNIFICANCE.
 I HAD
 THE
 FEELING
 THAT
 GUS
 WAS
 A STRANGE
 BIRD.
  FROM
 WHERE
 HE WAS
 INITIATED
 INTO
 THE
 MAGIC
 OF TEMASCAL,
 AND ALSO
 APPARENTLY
 ACQUAINTED
 WITH
 A BLUEBIRD. 
- "YOU
 KNOW,"
 HE BEGAN
 HUMBLY,
 "THIS
 COUNTRY
 WAS
 BUILT
 WITH
 GOOD
 INTENTIONS,
 BUT
 IN TODAY'S
 CHAOTIC
 WORLD,
 SURVIVAL
 FOR ANY
 OF US IS BECOMING
 INCREASINGLY
 DIFFICULT.
 AND
 NOW
 IT'S TIME
 TO SLEEP!" 
BY MORNING,
 GUS
 HAD
 DISAPPEARED,
 AND
 THE
 THREE
 OF US,
 ZONAR
 AND
 ARLO,
 LOOKED
 AROUND
 IN CONFUSION.
 WE WERE
 IN THE
 MIDDLE
 OF NOWHERE,
 SO TO SPEAK,
 AND
 THE
 FIRE
 AROUND
 US HAD
 BEEN
 CAREFULLY
 PUT
 OUT. 
- "AFTER
 ALL,
 GUS
 DID
 QUITE
 ENOUGH
 FOR
 US!,"
 ZONARA
 STARTED
 TO SAY,
 BUT AFTER
 A WHILE
 WE SAW
 HIS
 PICKUP
 COMING
 FROM
 SOMEWHERE. 
- "I
 HAD
 TO STOP
 AT A GAS
 STATION
 ABOUT
 FIFTEEN
 OR TWENTY
 MILES
 AWAY
 TO BUY SOME
 PROVISIONS.
 IT'S
 NOT
 GOOD
 TO GO TO THE
 RESERVE
 EMPTY-HANDED!,"
 HE EXPLAINED
 TO US CAREFULLY. 
AFTER
 A COUPLE
 OF HOURS
 WE BEGAN
 TO MAKE
 OUT
 THE
 OUTLINE
 OF A MENOMINEE,
 WHICH
 BEGAN
 TO SLOWLY
 EMERGE
 IN FRONT
 OF US,
 AND
 THERE
 WE HOPED
 TO FIND
 A BLUEBIRD. 
- "MANY
 OF THE
 INDIANS
 WHO
 ARE
 HERE
 MUST
 ALSO
 ENGAGE
 IN GAMBLING
 TO SURVIVE,
 BUT IT IS DONE
 122 
 MAINLY
 AMONG
 MEMBERS
 OF THE
 COMMUNITY.
 BUT THE
 TRUTH
 IS THAT
 THEY
 ARE
 VERY
 GOOD
 BUSINESSMEN
 AND
 THEY
 UNDERSTAND
 WHAT
 THEY
 ARE
 DOING
 WELL
 ENOUGH,
 MAYBE
 EVEN BETTER
 THAN
 A LOT
 OF OTHERS,"
 EXPLAINED
 GUS.
 "THE
 GAMBLING
 BUSINESS
 IS THEIRS
 AND
 A BLUEBIRD
 IS A SERIO
US PERSON.
 KEEP
 IN MIND
 THAT
 THEIR
 LAWS
 RULE
 ON THE
 RESERVATION,"
 GAS
 CONCLUDED
 HIS
 TIRADE,
 "BY
 THE
 WAY,
 THE
 AMERICAN
 GOVERNMENT
 HAS
 LEGALIZED
 THE
 USE
 OF MARIJUANA
 ON THE
 RESERVATION
11. IN PRACTICE,
 THIS
 RESERVE
 FUNCTIONS
 AS A PARALLEL
 STATE." 

ARLO
 WAS
 VERY
 HAPPY
 WHEN
 HE HEARD
 THIS,
 BECAUSE
 HE COULD
 OFFER
 THE
 INDIANS
 RARE
 VARIETIES
 OF DUTCH
 HEMP
 - IF THEY
 WERE
 INTERESTED,
 OF COURSE,
 AND
 THE
 PRICE
 SUITED
 THEM. 
AFTER
 WE HAD
 WALKED
 AROUND
 WITH
 THE
 ZONAR
 AND
 ARLO,
 WE QUESTIONED
 THE
 NATIVES
 ABOUT
 SOME
 PECULIARITI
ES OF THE
 LOCAL
 CULTURE,
 AND
 THEY
 PROMISED
 TO NOTIFY
 BLUEBIRD
 OF OUR
 ARRIVAL. 
- "IT TURNED
 OUT
 THAT
 THE
 BLUEBIRD
 WAS
 OUT
 ON BUSINESS
 SOMEWHERE,
 BUT
 WOULD
 BE BACK
 AT DUSK,"
 GUS
 INFORMED
 US,
 WHO
 TO MY AMAZEMENT
 SPOKE
 THE
 LOCAL
 LANGUAGE
 QUITE
 FLUENTLY. 
YOU
 SHOULD
 HAVE
 HEARD
 THOSE
 EVER
 SO MELODIOUS
 SOUNDS,
 FULL
 OF MYSTICISM.
 I THANKED
 THE
 ALMIGHTY
 THAT
 THERE
 WERE
 NO COYOTES
 HANGING
 AROUND
 - OR AT LEAST
 NOT
 WHERE
 WE WERE. 
THE
 PEOPLE
 SEEMED
 EXTREMELY
 CONSIDERATE
 AND
 OPEN
 TO ME, YET
 WE WERE
 STRANGERS
 AND
 THEY
 COULD
 NOT
 WELCOME
 US WITH
 OPEN
 ARMS. 
                                               
 11 In fact, the U.S. equivalent of the Department of Jus
tice 
implements similar authorization for all Indian tribes
 within the 
United States. 
123 
 BLUEBIRD
 WAS
 LINGERING,
 AND
 NOW
 NIGHT
 WAS
 FALLING,
 AND
 WE WONDERED
 IF WE WOULD
 EVEN
 BE ABLE
 TO SEE HIM
 OR IF WE WOULD
 JUST
 HAVE
 TO WAIT
 UNTIL
 MORNING. 
GUS
 SUGGESTED
 WE EAT
 SOMETHING
 FROM
 HIS
 PROVISIONS
 AND
 I ACCEPTED
 WHOLEHEARTEDLY
 - IT WAS
 BETTER
 THAN
 NOTHING. 
- "BASICALLY,"
 GUS
 DECIDED
 TO USE
 THE
 LITTLE
 TIME
 HE HAD
 TO FILL
 US IN ON SOME
 DETAILS,
 "THE
 SIOUX
 ARE
 ONE
 OF THE
 MOST
 PROSPEROUS
 AND
 WEALTHY
 TRIBAL
 COMMUNITIES
 IN THE
 US PRECISELY
 BECAUSE
 OF THE
 GAMBLING
 BUSINESS,
 BUT
 A BLUEBIRD
 IS A CAYUGA,
 AND
 THIS
 TRIBE
 ALSO
 INHABITS
 ONTARIO
 IN CANADA,
 WHERE
 THEY
 INHABIT
 THE
 SIX
 NATIONS
 RESERVE
 NEAR
 GRAND
 RIVER
 IN CANADA.
 I'M
 ASSUMING
 BLUEBIRD
 IS SOME
 SORT
 OF LIAISON
 BETWEEN
 THE
 TRIBES
 AND
 IS GETTING
 SOME
 SERIOUS
 DIVIDENDS
 FROM THERE." 
LATER,
 GUS
 MAY
 HAVE
 BEEN
 RIGHT. 
MAYBE
 THERE
 HAD
 BEEN
 SOME
 SORT
 OF ALTERCATION
 OR DISARRAY,
 BUT BLUEBIRD
 WAS
 DEFINITELY
 NOT
 COMING,
 AND
 IT WAS
 GETTING
 LATE.
 WE WONDERED
 IF WE SHOULD
 GO TO BED
 WITH
 ZONARA,
 OR IF ARLO
 WAS
 GOING
 TO CONTINUE
 SMOKING
 HIS
 MARIJUANA,
 WHICH
 HAD
 CAUGHT
 THE
 EYE OF THE
 LOCALS,
 AND
 STAND
 A KIND
 OF COMBAT
 DUTY. 
NOTHING
 INTERESTING
 WAS
 HAPPENING,
 AND
 I WAS
 STILL
 EXPECTING
 SOME
 SORT
 OF RESOLUTION. 
AT ONE
 TIME
 I HEARD
 THAT
 A BLUEBIRD
 HAD
 RETURNED,
 AND
 I LEARNED
 FROM
 GUS
 HIMSELF,
 WHO
 COULD
 TRANSLATE
 THE
 INARTICULATE
 SOUNDS,
 THAT
 APPARENTLY
 HE HAD
 GONE
 AS FAR
 AS A NEW
 SCOTIA
 TO BEG
 FOR
 SOME
 PROTECTION
 FROM
 INFLUENTIAL
 POLITICIANS.
 BUT NOT
 TOO
 FAR
 FROM
 THE
 RESERVE
 HE HAD
 ENCOUNTERED
 SOME
 DRUG CARTEL
 124 
 REPRESENTATIVES
 HOT
 ON OUR
 HEELS
 WHO HAD
 WOUNDED
 HIM
 AND
 HE HAD
 MIRACULOUSLY
 ESCAPED.
 HE MIGHT
 NOT
 EVEN
 HAVE
 SURVIVED. 
- "THE
 MAGIC
 IS STRONG!"
 ZONARA
 PRONOUNCED,"AND
 I WILL
 SAVE
 HIM. 
YES, THERE
 WERE
 PEOPLE
 ON THE
 INDIAN
 RESERVATION
 WHO
 COULD
 HEAL
 SO-CALLED
 INCURABLE
 WOUNDS
 INFLICTED
 BY COLD OR FIREARMS,
 BUT
 ZONARA
 KNEW
 THE
 NATURE
 OF MAGIC
 ALL
 TOO
 DEEPLY
 AND
 WAS
 AWARE
 THAT
 THERE
 WAS
 ALSO
 DEMONIC
 INTERFERENCE
 HERE
 THAT
 MIGHT
 NOT
 BE SO WELL
 KNOWN
 TO THE
 NATIVES. 
BUT WE WERE
 ABOUT
 TO LEARN
 SOMETHING
 QUITE
 INTERESTING
 LATER! 
IT TURNED
 OUT
 THAT
 THE
 MEXICAN
 DRUG CARTELS
 DESIRED
 AND
 CRAVED
 CONTROL
 OVER
 CERTAIN
 TERRITORIES,
 SUCH
 AS THIS
 ONE,
 BECAUSE
 THEY
 COULD
 MORE
 EASILY
 DISPOSE
 OF THE
 DRUGS
 IN CANADA.
 APPARENTLY
 BLUEBIRD
 DIDN'T
 PARTICULARLY
 AGREE
 WITH
 THEIR
 ARGUMENTS
 AND
 THEY
 HAD
 HIM
 SHOT.
 TO MY EXPERIENCED
 EYE,
 WHICH
 WAS
 QUITE
 FAMILIAR
 WITH
 THE
 FELISTER
 ARSENAL,
 THE
 GUNSHOT
 WOUND
 WAS
 MOST
 LIKELY
 CAUSED
 BY A REVOLVER
 OF SOME
 SORT,
 BUT
 I HAD
 NO KNOWLEDGE
 OF BALLISTICS. 
BLUEBIRD
 WAS
 STILL
 BREATHING.
 LIFE
 SEEMED TO BE LEAVING
 HIM,
 AND
 HE WAS
 UNWILLING
 TO GO JUST
 LIKE
 THAT
 - WITHOUT
 PASSING
 ON HIS
 KNOWLEDGE
 OF THE
 ASTRAL
 WORLD
 TO SOMEONE
 ELSE.
 AROUND
 HIM,
 ZONARA
 HOVERED,
 FEELING
 THE
 NEED
 TO HELP
 HER
 SPIRIT
 MENTOR,
 AS SHE
 CALLED
 HIM.
 THERE
 WAS
 A NEED
 TO PERFORM
 SOME
 RITUALS. 
- "THERE
 IS AN INTERESTING
 CONCEPT
 IN INDIAN
 BELIEFS,'
 GUS
 BEGAN,
 'THEY
 DON'T
 BELIEVE
 THERE
 IS AN AFTERWORLD,
 JUST
 THAT
 SOULS
 INHABIT
 THIS
 ONE
 125 
 IN A MORE
 SPECIAL
 WAY
12. EACH
 OF US POSSESSES
 A 'NAGI',"
 GUS
 CONTINUED,
 "OR
 IT IS A SHADOW.
 IT IS TRUE
 THAT
 THE
 INHABITANTS
 OF THIS
 RESERVATION
 ARE
 NOT
 OF THE
 GREAT
 PLAINS,
 AND
 THE
 VIEWS
 OF THE
 TRIBES
 DIFFER
 SOMEWHAT.
 BUT
 IF BLUEBIRD
 SURVIVES,
 YOU
 WILL
 HEAR
 MANY
 INTERESTING
 AND
 USEFUL
 THINGS
 FROM
 HIS
 OWN
 LIPS." 
 
CHAPTER
 THIRTEEN:
 SINGING
 SHADOW 
 
THE
 MEMBERS
 OF THE
 TRIBE
 HAD
 LEARNED
 JUST
 WHAT
 HAD
 HAPPENED
 TO BLUEBIRD,
 WHO
 WAS
 HARVESTING
 A SOUL,
 AND
 SOME
 OF THE
 MOST
 EMINENT
 HEALERS
 AND
 SHAMANS
 EXPRESSED
 A DESIRE
 TO HELP
 HIM. 
THE
 REGULAR
 INDIAN
 SHAMANS
 SOMETIMES
 HAD
 A MOST
 ORDINARY
 OCCUPATION.
 THE
 TIMES
 HAD
 LONG
 BEEN
 QUITE
 MODERN. 
- "MUST"-
 ONLY
 TO DIE,
 MUTTERED
 THE
 OLD INDIAN
 WISDOM
 TO THE
 ARRIVING
 WOMAN
 SHAMAN. 
ZONARA
 ALMOST
 CRIED
 OUT
 - SHE
 WAS
 THE
 SAME
 ONE
 WHO
 SENT
 US AWAY
 AND
 DIDN'T
 REVEAL
 HER
 VISION
 OF THE
 GREAT
 SPIRIT,
 AND
 THAT
 WAS
 HARDLY
 JUST
 A COINCIDENCE.
 IT'S
 LIKE
 THE
 PARABLE
 OF THE
 TWO
 WOLV
ES13- THE
 ONE
 YOU
 FEED
 WILL
 WIN. 
THE
 WOMAN
 WAS
 FROM
 THE
 CAYUGA
 TRIBE,
 BUT
 IT WAS
 INTERESTING
 WHAT
 SHE
 WAS
 DOING
 ON A RESERVATION
 OF A COMPLETELY
 DIFFERENT
 MENOMINEE
 INDIAN
 GROUP. 
                                               
 12 This concept of death is characteristic of Western Sioux.
 13 A famous Indian parable expressing the inner struggle
 between good and evil. 
126 
 - "OUR
 TRIBE,
 ALONG
 WITH
 THE
 OTHERS,
 HAS
 UNITED
 UNDER
 THE
 GREAT
 LAW
 OF PEACE,
 BUT
 APPARENTLY
 THERE
 ARE
 THINGS
 BEYOND
 OUR
 CONTROL,"
 THE
 SHAMAN
 SAID
 SADLY. 
- "MY NAME
 IS SINGING
 SHADOW,"
 SHE
 SMILED,
 "AND
 BELIEVE
 IT OR NOT
 MY AGE
 DOESN'T
 MATCH
 MY APPEARANCE.
 WHEN
 YOU
 MAKE
 AN ALLIANCE
 WITH
 THE
 SPIRITS,
 THEY
 CAN
 DO MANY
 THINGS
 FOR YOU
 AND YOU
 CAN
 SEE WORLDS
 - UNAVAILABLE
 TO MOST."
 AND
 SING
 A STRANGE
 SONG: 
''WHEN
 THE
 ROAD
 CLOSES, 
WHERE
 WILL
 YOU
 RUN, YOU
 WEIRDO, 
THY
 SOUL
 IS NOT
 HERE, 
LIFE
 IS HARD
 TO REACH.
'' ARLO
 - AS A REPRESENTATIVE
 OF THE
 HIPPAR
 CULTURE
 AGREED
 THAT
 THE
 LYRICS
 WERE
 DEFINITELY
 NOT
 CANONICAL
 TO THOSE
 OF MOST
 RELIGIONS,
 BUT
 STILL
 PATIENTLY
 WAITED
 FOR
 THE
 FEMALE
 SHAMAN
 TO SHUT
 UP. 

- "WE SHAMANS
 COMMUNICATE
 WITH
 THE
 SPIRIT
 WORLD
 THROUGH
 THE
 EARTH
 SPIRIT,"
 THE
 OLD
 WOMAN
 EXPLAINED. 

WE WERE
 NOT
 ALLOWED
 TO LOOK
 AT THE
 FACE
 OF A BLUEBIRD.
 SHE
 HAD
 A FEVER
 AND
 PROBABLY
 WOULDN'T
 JUMP
 OVER
 THE
 GANGPLANK.
 HOWEVER,
 ZONARA
 ASKED
 THE
 OLD WOMAN
 IF SHE
 COULD
 HELP
 HER
 IF SHE
 HERSELF
 COULD
 NOT
 SAVE
 HER
 SON.
 THE
 OLD WOMAN
 WAS
 NOT
 TOO
 APPROVING
 OF THE
 SUGGESTION,
 BUT
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND
 SHE
 SAW ZONARA
'S WILLINGNESS
 TO PROVIDE
 REAL
 HELP: 
- "THE
 DEMON
 WORLD
 CAN
 BE VERY
 DANGEROUS,
 BUT
 THE
 PATH
 OF ALL
 OF US IS TOO LONG
 - WHETHER
 WE 127 
 SEE IT OR NOT!,"
 THE
 OLD WOMAN
 FOLDED
 HER
 ARMS
 STRANGELY,
 GIVING
 HER
 PLACE
 TO ZONARA
 WHO
 DECIDED
 TO TRY
 HER
 POWER
 AND
 BRING
 THE
 DYING
 MAN
 TO LIFE. 
GUS
 HAD
 REMAINED
 BY OUR
 SIDE
 AS AN INTERPRETER,
 NOT
 TO INTERVENE
 IF NECESSARY. 
- "KAYLAN
14,"
 THE
 OLD WOMAN
 TURNED
 TO A DOG
 HOWLING
 ITS
 TAIL
 AROUND,
 "LET'S
 LET
 THEM
 DO THEIR
 JOB,
 AND
 IF HE'S
 MEANT
 TO LIVE,
 HE'LL
 JUMP
 THE
 GANGPLANK
 - AND THAT'S
 THAT.
 BUT
 IF NOT,
 HE SHALL
 HAVE
 A DECENT
 BURIAL!" 
ZONARA
 STAGGERED
 BY THE
 DYING
 MAN
 - YES HE DEFINITELY
 LOOKED
 LIKE
 HE ALREADY
 HAD
 ONE
 FOOT
 IN THE
 AFTERLIFE.
 IT TOOK
 HER
 ONLY
 A MOMENT
 TO DISCOVER
 WHAT
 WAS
 REALLY
 HIS. 
- JUST
 EXHIBITING
 SIGNS
 OF DEMONIC
 POSSESSION,
 WHICH
 I THINK
 MAKE
 THINGS
 SEEM
 NOT
 EXACTLY
 WHAT
 THEY
 ACTUALLY
 ARE.
 THE
 QUESTION
 IS,
 WHO
 HAD
 A VESTED
 INTEREST
 IN CAUSING
 THIS
 TO HIM?
 APPARENTLY
 THE
 CARTELS
 HAVE
 SNIFFED
 US OUT
 AND
 KNOW
 FULL
 WELL
 THAT
 SOONER
 OR LATER
 THEY
 WILL
 GET
 TO US AND
 WE WILL
 JUST
 SETTLE
 THE
 SCORE
 ONCE
 AND
 FOR ALL. 
ZONARA'S
 FACE
 LOOKED
 MANLY
 AND
 SHE
 SPOKE
 WITH
 A CONFIDENCE
 THAT
 SEEMED
 TO INSPIRE
 EVEN
 ARLO
 HIMSELF.
 HE LISTENED
 TO HER
 INTENTLY
 AND
 SOAKED
 UP HER
 WORDS
 LIKE
 A DAMP
 SPONGE.
 HE COULD
 SEE HER
 DEEP
 KNOWLEDGE
 OF DEMONIC
 MAGIC
 AND HER
 DESIRE
 TO USE
 IT TO HEAL. 
- "HE IS SPIRITUALLY
 DEAD,"
 ZONARA
 ANNOUNCED,
 LOOMING
 OVER
 THE
 PALE
 FACE
 OF THE
 INDIAN.
 "HE
 HAS
 LONG
 SINCE
 PASSED
 INTO
 THE
 SHADOW
 WORLD.
 PLUS,
 RAISING
 A DEAD
 MAN
 WOU
LD HAVE
 SERIOUS
                                                
 14   Kaylan - warrior of life. 
128 
 CONSEQUENCES
 FOR
 ME. BUT
 THEN
 AGAIN,
 I DON'T
 HAVE
 A CHOICE
 IF WE WANT
 TO FIND
 FELISTER
'S LEGACY!
 I DON'T
 KNOW
 IF YOU
 ARE
 AWARE
 THAT
 THERE
 IS A PROCESS
 WHERE
 WE CAN
 OPEN
 TWO
 HOLES
 FOR
 TWO
 CREATURES
 FROM
 THE
 SPIRIT
 WORLD
 TO PASS
 THROUGH
 INTO
 OURS,
 BUT ONE
 OF THEM
 WILL
 MOST
 LIKELY
 BE A DEMON,
 AND
 THE
 TWO
 SPIRITS
 WILL
 BE CONNECTED
 IN A PARTICULAR
 WAY." 
- "DO IT!"
 I SHOUTED,
 AMAZED
 AT MY OWN
 COURAGE.
 - "CAN'T
 YOU
 SEE THAT
 FELISTER
 HAS
 LEFT
 US NO LEGACY
 EXCEPT
 THOSE
 GRIMOIRES!
 IT IS QUITE
 POSSIBLE
 THAT
 THERE
 MAY
 BE NOTHING
 ELSE,
 BUT AT LEAST
 WE CAN
 BEG
 OF THE
 GUARDIAN
 ANGEL
 A REAL
 SALVATION
 FOR OUR
 DAMNED
 SOULS!" 
MY DESPERATE
 FACE
 AND
 TONE
 OF VOICE
 SEEMED
 TO HAVE
 AN EFFECT
 ON THE
 ZONAR,
 AND
 SHE
 SET
 ABOUT
 PERFORMING
 THE
 RITUAL. 
- BUT
 FROM
 NOW
 ON,
 KNOW THAT
 IT IS TERRIBLY
 DANGEROUS
 AND
 WE CAN
 EASILY
 FALL
 PREY
 TO SOME
 MISTAKE
 IN MATERIALIZING
 THE
 DEMON! 
ARLO
 WAS
 AS IF IN A TRANCE,
 AND
 I DISTINCTLY
 HEARD
 THE
 RUSTLING
 OF THE
 INDIANS,
 WHO
 WERE
 OUTSIDE
 THE
 HUT
 AND
 EVIDENTLY
 FORESEEING
 THAT
 SOME
 PARTICULARLY
 UNCLEAN
 POWERS
 WOULD
 BE CALLED
 UPON
 TO BREATHE
 LIFE
 INTO
 THE
 DEAD
 MAN. 
- "SHADOW
 AND
 SOUL
 ARE
 DIFFERENT
 CONCEPTS,"
 THE
 ZONAR
 CONTINUED,
 "BUT
 WE DON'T
 HAVE
 TIME
 FOR THAT
 NOW!" 
THE
 PERFORMANCE
 OF THE
 RITUAL
 WAS
 UNUSUALLY
 COMPLEX,
 BUT
 ZONARA
 UNDERSTOOD
 MAGIC
 AS WELL
 AS FINANCE.
 THE
 DEAD
 MAN'S
 MOUTH
 SEEMED
 TO MOVE
 SUBTLY
 AND
 HE CLEARLY
 SEEMED TO CATCH
 HIS
 BREATH.
 IT ALMOST
 MADE
 ME LOSE
 MY OWN
 SANITY.
 THE
 ACTION
 ITSELF
 WAS
 LIKE
 A SIGH,
 WHICH
 WAS
 A KIND
 OF IMPACT
 ON MATTER
 - AS IF A BLUEBIRD
 WAS
 129 
 SIMPLY
 ASKING
 US
 TO LEAVE
 IT ALONE
 AND
 WAS
 EXPRESSING
 ITS
 ANNOYANCE
 IN THIS
 WAY. 
HOWEVER,
 ZONARA
 WAS
 TOO
 BUSY
 SAYING
 THE
 RIGHT
 INCANTATIONS
 AND
 PRAYERS
 AND
 ALSO
 PERFORMING
 THE
 MAGICAL
 RITUAL
 ITSELF. 
- THE
 FACT
 THAT
 THE
 DEAD
 MAN
 HAD
 NOT
 BEEN
 PLACED
 UNDER
 THE
 SO-CALLED
 "SPIRIT
 HOUSE"
 ALSO
 GAVE
 ME GREAT
 FREEDOM
 - IT WOULD
 HAVE
 MADE
 MY WORK
 EXCEEDINGLY
 DIFFICULT. 
ARLO
 WANTED
 TO DRINK
 SOME
 WATER
 AND
 SOME
 OF THE
 LOCALS
 TOOK HIM
 OUTSIDE
 TO QUENCH
 HIS
 THIRST,
 BUT
 I CLEARLY
 NOTICED
 THE
 DEMONIC
 SHADOW
 THAT
 SEEMED
 TO APPEAR
 INSIDE
 THE
 INDIAN
 TEPEE. 

- "WHY
 DID
 THE
 OLD WOMAN
 HAVE
 SUCH
 AN ATTITUDE
 TOWARDS
 A BLUE
 BIRD?,"
 ASKED
 THE
 ZONORA
 BLUNTLY.
 "HER
 BEHAVIOR
 SEEMED
 UNNATURAL
 AND
 EVEN A LITTLE
 STRANGE
 TO ME - AS IF THIS
 WAS
 NOT
 ACTUALLY
 HER
 SON,
 BUT
 SOMETHING
 ELSE
 SOME
 UNBORN
 DEAD
 PERSON
 OR EVEN A DEMON." 
THE
 SHADOW
 REMAINED
 LIFELESS
 FOR
 A WHILE,
 AND
 I CLEARLY
 FELT
 THE
 TENT
 FILL
 WITH
 NEGATIVE
 ENERGY. 
- "YOU
 HAVE
 GREAT
 COURAGE,
 MERE
 MORTAL,"
 THE
 DEMON
 SPOKE,
 "THOUGH
 I WAS
 CREATED
 BY YOUR
 MAGICAL
 INFLUENCE,
 NEVER
 FORGET
 SOMETHING
 IMPORTANT
 - I SEE AND
 FEEL
 THINGS
 YOU
 DO NOT.
 AND
 BLUEBIRD
 WAS
 NOT
 WHO
 HE CLAIMED
 TO BE." 
- IN KAMALOKA
15, ANYTHING
 IS POSSIBLE
 - WELL,
 ALMOST
 ANYTHING.
 SOME
 PARTICULARLY
 CAPABLE
 SHAMANS
 CAN
 EVEN BUILD
 THEIR
 OWN
 ASTRAL
 WORLD.
 AND
 SOME
 DO INDEED
 - THERE
 THEY
 CAN
 MAKE
 THEIR
                                                
 15  Kamaloka - a world of passions. 
130 
 SPIRITUAL
 JOURNEYS
 IN A CONTROLLED
 ENVIRONMENT,
 AS THEY
 PUT
 IT. 
THERE
 SEEMED
 TO BE SOMETHING
 BETWEEN
 NOSTALGIA
 AND
 DERISION
 IN THE
 DEMON'S
 INHUMAN
 VOICE. 

- "REVEAL
 TO US THE
 TRUTH,"
 ZONARA
 COMMANDED,
 AND
 FOR FURTHER
 PROTECTION
 SHE
 HAD
 DESCRIBED
 A MAGICAL
 TRIANGLE
 TO KEEP
 THE
 SPIRIT
 IN CHECK,
 AND SHE
 HAD CONSTRUCTED
 A MAGICAL
 CIRCLE
 AROUND
 HERSELF
 FOR PROTECTION
 AGAINST
 ANY
 NEGATIVE
 INTERFERENCE
 OR SUDDEN
 ATTACK. 
- "THE
 ASTRAL
 WORLDS
 ARE
 SO STRANGE
 IN THEIR
 NATURE,"
 THE
 DEMON
 REPLIED
 LAZILY,
 "GEOMETRICALLY
 DISPROPORTIONATE,
 AND
 THERE
 IS SPIRITUALITY
 IN THE
 ASTRAL
 AS WELL.
 BUT
 YOU
 ASK
 ME ABOUT
 A BLUEBIRD!" 
ZONARA
 WATCHED,
 SPELLBOUND,
 THE
 MYSTIC
 GAMES
 OF SHADOW
 ON THE
 CANVAS
 OF THE
 INDIAN
 TEPEE.
 ONE
 MIGHT
 EASILY
 BE MISTAKEN
 FOR THINKING
 THAT
 THIS
 WAS
 MERELY
 A PLAY
 OF LIGHT,
 BUT
 TO THE
 INITIATED
 IT WAS
 ONLY
 A CONNECTION
 TO A MORE
 SPIRITUAL
 WORLD. 

- HE TRIED
 TO SAVE
 HIS
 OWN
 PEOPLE,
 BUT
 HIS
 CAUSE
 WAS
 LOST!
 HIS
 PATH
 HAD
 TO STOP
 THERE!
 HE WANTED
 SOMETHING
 THAT
 WAS
 BEYOND
 HIS
 POWER
 AND
 NEVER
 WAS.
 IT MAY ALSO
 BE SAID
 THAT
 HE OVERESTIMATED
 HIMSELF
 TO SOME
 EXTENT. 
- "AND
 WHY
 DID
 THEY
 KILL
 HIM
 ZONARA
 ASKED
 GENTLY. 

- "MURDER
 ISN'T
 THE
 RIGHT
 WORD,"
 THE
 DEMON
 SPOKE
 WITHOUT
 BEING
 AT ALL
 IMPRESSED,
 "WE SHOULD
 ANSWER
 THE
 QUESTION
 OF WHO
 HAD
 A STAKE
 IN LURING
 THE
 BLUEBIRD
 AND
 HIS
 DEMISE.
 YES, YOU
 HAVE
 A SPECIAL
 POWER
 THAT
 WILL KEEP
 HIS
 SOUL
 IN YOUR
 131 
 WORLD,
 BUT
 I'LL
 BE AROUND
 TOO - AT LEAST
 WITHIN
 THIS
 RESURRECTION
 AND
 UNDER
 THESE
 CONDITIONS.
 DEMONS
 CAN'T
 HEAL,"
 THE
 SHADOW
 CONTINUED,
 AND
 YOU
 LIED
 TO YOUR
 COMPANIONS
 ABOUT
 IT,
 AS WELL
 AS THE
 SHAMAN,
 WHO
 IS CLEARLY
 NOT
 AS INITIATED
 INTO
 DEMONIC
 MAGIC
 AS SHE
 SHOULD
 BE.
 'BUT
 YOU
 WALK
 A THORNY
 PATH,
 ZONARA,
 MY CREATOR,
 MY LINK
 TO YOUR
 WORLD,
 WHICH
 IS ALREADY
 RATHER
 DULL
 - AND
 EVEN SOMEWHAT
 POINTLESS.
 THE
 DRUG CARTELS
 WILL
 FIND
 YOU,
 AND
 IT'S
 ONLY
 A MATTER
 OF TIME,
 BUT THE
 SECRET
 YOU
 WANT
 TO KNOW,
 YOU
 MUST
 SUFFER
 - REMEMBER
 FELISTER
'S WORDS
 THAT
 THE
 KEY
 TO UNLOCKING
 THE
 MYSTERY
 LIES
 IN HIS
 HERITAGE." 
THE
 GHOST
 THEN
 FELL
 SILENT
 - CLEARLY
 NOT
 WANTING
 TO CONTINUE
 WHAT
 HE THOUGHT
 WAS
 AN UNNECESSARY
 CONVERSATION. 
MORTALS
 WERE
 SOMETIMES
 BIG
 ASSES,
 REFUSING
 TO ACCEPT
 AND
 ACKNOWLEDGE
 THE
 OBVIOUS,
 WHICH
 ONLY
 CREATED
 PROBLEMS
 FOR SUPERNATURAL
 ENTITIES
 - EVEN THOSE
 THAT
 WERE
 ARTIFICIALLY
 CREATED
 THROUGH
 ENERGY. 
ARLO
 WAS
 A LITTLE
 SHOCKED,
 BUT
 HE COULD
 SEE
 THE
 EFFORT
 ZONARA
 HAD
 MADE
 TO DEAL
 WITH
 THE
 PROBLEM.
 AS MUCH
 AS HE HATED
 TO ADMIT
 IT - HER
 ABILITIES
 AS A MAGE
 WERE
 IMMENSE
 - AND
 SOMEWHAT
 COMPLETELY
 UNPREDICTABLE. 
- "EVEN IF THE
 DEMON
 HEALS
 YOU,
 IT WILL
 DAMAGE
 YOUR
 IMMORTAL
 SOUL,"
 ARLO
 GRUMBLED,
 DOING
 HIS
 BEST
 NOT
 TO LET
 ZONARA
 HEAR
 HIM
 OR UNDERSTAND
 HIS
 THOUGHTS,
 "AND
 THE
 DEVIL
 IS ALWAYS
 THE
 DEVIL
 - THE
 ENEMY
 OF MEN!" 
THE
 INDIANS
 ON THE
 RESERVATION
 HAD
 THE
 STRANGE
 FEELING
 THAT
 TROUBLE
 WOULD
 SOON
 BE LOOMING
 OVER
 THEIR
 OWN
 HEADS,
 AND
 SO THEY
 WERE
 NOT
 VERY
 CHEERFUL. 
132 
 THE
 RUMOR
 THAT
 BLUEBIRD
 HAD
 BEEN
 WOUNDED
 AND
 SUBSEQUENTLY
 DIED
 OF HIS
 OWN
 WOUNDS
 SPREAD
 RAPIDLY
 AMONG
 THE
 OTHER
 MEMBERS
 OF THE
 MENOMINEE
 TRIBE. 
- "THOUGH
 HE WAS
 NOT
 ONE
 OF OUR
 OWN,
 THIS
 CAYUGA
 HAD
 HELPED
 US A GOOD DEAL,
 AND
 PROMINENT
 POLITICIANS
 OF INDIAN
 DESCENT
 HAD
 STOOD
 UP FOR US,"
 MUTTERED
 AN OLD INDIAN
 WITH
 A WRINKLED
 FACE,
 "WE
 TAKE
 OUR
 NAMES
 IN ACCORDANCE
 WITH
 THE
 WORLD
 AROUND
 US." 
THIS
 INDIAN'S
 NAME
 WAS
 BIG
 BROTHER,
 AND
 HE RAN A CONSIDERABLE
 GAMBLING
 OPERATION
 ON THE
 RESERVATION,
 BUT
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND
 BLUEBIRD
 HELPED
 HIM
 WITH
 SOME
 ADMINISTRATIVE
 FORMALITIES
 AND
 NEGOTIATIONS
 WITH
 THE
 AUTHORITIES
 BECAUSE
 OF HIS
 MORE
 SERIOUS
 CONNECTIONS
 WITH
 THEM. 
BIG
 BROTHER
 HAD
 ALWAYS
 WANTED
 TO BECOME
 BLUEBIRD'S
 APPRENTICE
 AND
 HAVE
 HIM
 INITIATE
 HIM
 INTO
 THE
 SECRETS
 OF HIS
 ART.
 HE'D
 BEGGED
 HIM
 AND
 EVEN OFFERED
 HIM
 FIVE
 PERCENT
 OF THE
 ENTIRE
 GAMBLING
 REVENUE
 OF THE
 RESERVATION-AND
 THAT
 WAS
 A HELL
 OF A LOT. 
BLUEBIRD
 HAD
 ALWAYS
 TURNED
 DOWN
 THE
 OFFER
 WITH
 A SMILE,
 OBVIOUSLY
 HAVING
 SOMETHING
 ON HIS
 MIND. 

- "TRAVELLING
 THE
 ASTRAL
 WORLDS
 CAN
 BE VERY
 DANGEROUS,"
 HE HAD
 EXPLAINED,
 "ESPECIALLY
 FOR THE
 UNINITIATED
 - DON'T
 ASK
 THAT
 OF ME,
 BIG
 BROTHER!" 

AND
 INDEED
 BIG
 BROTHER
 WAS
 A FEW
 YEARS
 OLDER THAN
 BLUEBIRD,
 WHO
 VOTED
 HIM
 SENIORITY. 
BIG
 BROTHER
 WAS
 ALWAYS
 TEMPERATE
 IN HIS
 WORDS,
 WISE,
 BUT
 EAGER
 FOR
 ADVENTURE,
 WHICH
 HAD
 GOTTEN
 HIM
 INTO
 A LOT
 OF TROUBLE. 
133 
 AND
 BLUEBIRD
 WAS
 ALWAYS
 A PRAGMATIST,
 HE OFTEN
 SAID: 

- LIFE
 IS NOT
 ABOUT
 LOVE,
 IT'S
 ABOUT
 LIVING. 
AND
 THOUGH
 THIS
 WISDOM
 DIDN'T
 QUITE
 FIT INTO
 INDIAN
 FOLKLORE
 - BIG
 BROTHER
 KNEW
 BLUEBIRD
 WAS
 RIGHT. 

SOCIAL
 INEQUALITY,
 TEENAGE
 PREGNANCY,
 SAME-
SEX MARRIAGE
 AND
 SO ON STILL
 REIGNED
 ON RESERVATIONS. 

BUT THE
 BALANCE
 WAS
 PRESERVED
 WITH
 GREAT
 EFFORT
 AND
 LIFE WAS
 STILL
 POSSIBLE. 
BLUEBIRD
 NEVER
 ASKED
 HIM
 EXACTLY
 WHY
 BIG
 BROTHER
 WANTED
 TO GO TO THE
 ASTRAL
 WORLDS
 THAT
 HAD
 NOTHING
 TO DO WITH
 THE
 HUMAN
 ONE. 
NOW
 BIG
 BROTHER
 WAS
 SMOKING
 HIS
 PIPE,
 WHICH
 THE
 INDIANS
 CALLED
 THE
 INDIAN
 PIPE
 WAS
 SYMBOLIC
 IN NATURE,
 ITS
 HEAD
 REPRESENTING
 THE
 EARTH
 AND
 THE
 STONE
 FROM
 WHICH
 THE
 PLANET
 EARTH
 HAD
 BEEN
 CREATED
 AT THE
 BEGINNING
 OF TIME,
 ITS
 MOUTHPIECE
 REPRESENTING
 ALL
 THE
 PLANTS,
 AND
 THE
 VARIOUS
 DECORATIONS
 SUCH
 AS BARBED
 PIG
 NEEDLES,
 EAGLE
 FEATHERS,
 AND
 SO ON,
 THE
 ANIMAL
 KINGDOM.
 THE
 BIG
 BROTHER
 SUCKED
 THOUGHTFULLY
 AND
 MUTTERED: 
- HOPEFULLY
 A BLUEBIRD
 WILL
 HOP
 OVER
 THE
 GANGPLANK.
 ALL
 IS IN THE
 HANDS
 OF THE
 GREAT
 SPIRIT.
  THE
 SILENCE
 OF THE
 PRESERVE
 WAS
 BROKEN
 BY THE
 DISTANT
 HOWL
 OF A COYOTE
 THAT
 HAD
 APPARENTLY
 GONE
 HUNTING. 
SINGING
 SHADOW
 KNEW
 THAT
 EVEN IF HE WERE
 BROUGHT
 BACK
 TO THE
 LIVING,
 UNCLEAN
 FORCES
 WOULD
 FOLLOW
 HER
 SON
 ON HIS
 EARTHLY
 PATH.
 SHE
 HAD
 TO COME
 TO TERMS
 WITH
 THAT
 FACT. 
134 
 - "MY STRENGTH
 WAS
 NOT
 ENOUGH,"
 SHE
 SHOOK
 HER
 HEAD
 SADLY,
 "SO IT TOOK
 SOMEONE
 ELSE'S
 INTERVENTION
 TO SAVE
 YOU,
 BUT THIS
 IS YOUR
 EARTHLY
 PATH,
 BLUEBIRD.
 YOU
 GAVE
 HOPE
 TO THE
 PEOPLE
 OF THIS
 RESERVE
 AND
 TRIED
 TO MAKE
 THEIR
 LIVES
 EASIER." 
ZONARA
 KNEW
 THAT
 SUMMONING
 THE
 DEMON
 TO BE BOUND
 TO THE
 SOUL
 OF THE
 SUFFERER
 WAS
 INEVITABLE.
 BUT
 SHE
 ALSO
 KNEW THAT
 THE
 RITUAL
 COULD
 HAVE
 CONSEQUENCES
 THAT
 COULD
 BE DANGEROUS. 

BLUEBIRD
 STIRRED
 AND
 OPENED
 HIS
 EYES. HE COULD
 SEE BLURRILY,
 BUT
 COULDN'T
 MOVE
 HIS
 LIPS.
 HE TRIED
 TO SAY
 SOMETHING,
 BUT
 THE
 WORDS
 COULDN'T
 COME
 OUT
 OF HIS
 MOUTH
 CLEARLY.
 HIS
 FACE
 WAS
 STILL
 PALE
 AND
 TORTURED
 - AS IF IT BORE
 THE
 SEAL
 OF DEMONIC
 INTERFERENCE. 

- "THEY
 SAY
 THE
 GREAT
 SPIRIT
 HEARS
 OUR
 PLEAS,"
 THE
 BLUEBIRD
 SPOKE
 WITH
 ANGUISH,
 'BUT
 ... 
ZONARA
 WATCHED
 HIM
 CAREFULLY. 
ARLO
 STOOD
 WITH
 AN IMPENETRABLE
 FACE,
 ONLY
 PARTLY
 VISIBLE
 BECAUSE
 OF THE
 DARKNESS
 IN THE
 INDIAN
 TENT. 
- "WHAT
 HAPPENED?,"
 ZONARA
 ASKED
 HIM
 GENTLY,
 "WHO
 WERE
 THEY
?," BLUEBIRD
 STARED
 AT HER
 IN SURPRISE
 - IT HAD
 CLEARLY
 TAKEN
 HIM
 SOME
 TIME
 TO REALISE
 EXACTLY
 WHAT
 WAS
 HAPPENING.
 THIS
 WORLD
 AND
 THIS
 REALITY
 HAD
 ITS
 OWN
 LAWS
 AND
 HE HAD
 TO GET
 USED
 TO THEM
 AGAIN
 - THAT
 WAS
 THE
 PRICE
 OF HIS
 SALVATION! 

 
 
 135 
 CHAPTER
 FOURTEEN:
 BLUEBIRD 
 
AFTER
 AN IMMENSE
 EFFORT
 AND
 A STAMMER,
 HE SAID
 THE
 FOLLOWING: 
- THEY
 CAUGHT
 ME ON THE
 WAY
 BACK
 FROM
 A NEW
 SCOTIA
 AS I WAS
 PASSING
 THROUGH
 ONTARIO.
 AND
 BEFORE
 THE
 BORDER.
 THEY
 WERE
 ENOUGH.
 THEY
 WERE
 STRONG.
 THEY
 WERE
 STRONG!
 AND
 THEY
 WANTED
 TO LEARN
 SOMETHING.
 THEY
 THOUGHT
 THEY
 KNEW
 IT. AN UNEQUAL
 BATTLE
 BEGAN.
 THERE
 WERE
 NINE
 OR TEN.
 I KNOCKED
 DOWN
 FIVE
 OR SIX,
 BUT
 THE
 REST
 HAD
 GUNS
 AND
 STARTED
 SHOOTING.
 WHO
 EVER FOUND
 ME? SEEMS
 DAMN
 STRANGE
 TO ME! EVEN DEFIES
 ALL
 LOGIC. 
- "BUT
 YOU'RE
 STILL
 HERE,"
 ZONARA
 GRUNTED
 WITHOUT
 REVEALING
 ANYTHING. 
BLUEBIRD
 KEPT
 LYING.
 ON THE
 FLORAL
 INDIAN
 BLANKET
 THAT
 SERVED
 AS HIS
 BEDDING. 
- "I
 THINK
 IT IS FAR
 MORE
 APPROPRIATE
 TO
 SPEAK
 OF LIFE
 AFTER
 LIFE,"
 HE MUTTERED.
 "FOR I NEVER
 DIED!
 I WAS
 MERELY
 A TRAVELLER
 WHO
 RETURNED
 TO A PLACE
 HE KNEW
 WELL
 - FOR
 GOOD
 OR ILL!
 BUT
 IN ANY
 CASE
 THINGS
 WILL
 NOT
 END
 THERE!
 AND
 MAY
 EVEN BE JUST
 BEGINNING!" 
AT THIS
 TIME
 A SINGING
 SHADOW
 ENTERED
 THE
 TENT,
 AND
 BUSIED
 HIMSELF
 IN LOOKING
 AFTER
 HIS
 SON,
 OR WHAT
 SHOULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 HIM. 
ZONARA
 WENT
 OUTSIDE
 AND
 LEFT
 HER
 TO TEND
 TO HIS
 WOUNDS.
 SHE
 DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO OVERDO
 THE
 USE
 OF FORCE,
 FOR
 IT WASN'T
 RIGHT
 AND
 WOULD
 HARDLY
 EASE
 THE
 SUFFERER'S
 TORMENT
 ANY
 MORE. 
136 
 THE
 INDIANS
 OUTSIDE
 LOOKED
 AT HER
 WITH
 SOME
 STRANGE
 MIXTURE
 OF DISBELIEF
 AND
 RESPECT,
 FOR
 THEY
 NEEDED
 BLUEBIRD. 
ARLO
 HAD
 MANAGED
 TO SELL
 A GOOD DEAL
 OF HIS
 DUTCH
 WEED
 TO SOME
 OF THE
 MORE
 INTERESTED
 CUSTOMERS-YES,
 THE
 WEED
 COULD
 REPLACE
 THE
 TOBACCO
 THEY
 HAD
 PUT
 IN THEIR
 PIPES. 
SO HADN'T
 THEIR
 ANCESTORS
 SMOKED
 WEED
 BEFORE
 A FIGHT
 TO KEEP
 THEM
 OUT
 OF PAIN
 AND
 FIGHTING
 LIKE
 BEASTS! 

ARLO
 DECIDED
 TO SELL
 THE
 REST
 OF THE
 WEED
 AS WELL,
 TO GET
 SOME
 MONEY
 THAT
 MIGHT
 BE USEFUL
 TO HIM. 

THE
 HIPSTER
 HAD
 A VERY
 STRANGE
 EFFECT
 ON THOSE
 AROUND
 HIM,
 FOR SOMEWHERE
 IN THERE
 ONE
 COULD
 CLEARLY
 FEEL
 THE
 HOPELESS
 SADNESS
 THAT
 SEEMED
 TO HAVE
 OVERWHELMED
 THE
 MENOMINEES. 
- IS THIS
 THE
 LEGACY
 OF A FELISTER?
 THAT
 CRAZY,
 UNHINGED
 PIG
 CASTRATOR! 
ARLO
 WAS
 AS IF SPELLBOUND,
 GAZING
 AT THE
 BEAUTIFUL
 MOON
 WITH
 ITS
 PALE
 COLOUR
 BUT
 DISTINCT
 LUNAR
 CRATERS
 - A BRIGHT
 SPOT
 AGAINST
 ALL
 THIS
 DARKNESS. 

THE
 HIPSTER
 REALIZED
 THE
 AIMLESSNESS
 OF HIS
 LIFE.
 BUT HE HAD
 LIVED
 AS A MERCENARY
 FOR THE
 DRUG CARTELS-
OR RATHER,
 AS AN INFORMANT
 FOR SOME
 PETTY
 DETAIL.
 HE'D
 NEVER
 GOTTEN
 INTO
 THE
 BIG
 GAME-HAD
 NEVER
 EVEN SNIFFED
 IT. 
- "I'M
 USELESS
 AND
 I DON'T
 SEE WHY
 I'M
 HERE,"
 WHISPERED
 ARLO.
 "A LOST
 SOUL
 IN THE
 CYCLE
 OF EVENTS!
 SOME
 SAY
 THAT
 WE HIPSTERS
 ARE
 JUST
 GROWN
 UP KIDS,
 BUT
 IS THAT
 REALLY
 TRUE!
 AND
 137 
 WHETHER
 WE ARE
 NOT
 CARRYING
 THE
 HUGE
 BURDEN
 OF OUR
 PAST
 LIVES!" 
HE MAY
 HAVE
 BEEN
 ONLY
 ABOUT
 TWENTY-FIVE,
 BUT HIS
 FACE
 BETRAYED
 SOMEONE
 WHO
 SEEMED
 TO HAVE
 LIVED
 AT LEAST
 TWICE
 THAT
 LONG.
 HOWEVER
 MUCH
 SUFFERING
 ARLO
 ENDURED,
 HIS
 FACE
 REMAINED
 THE
 SAME,
 AND
 ONLY
 THE
 GLEAM
 IN HIS
 EYES
 COULD
 BETRAY
 THE
 DETERMINATION
 OF HIS
 INTENTIONS. 
I APPROACHED
 ARLO
 WITHOUT
 HIS
 SENSING
 ME.
 I FELT
 SOMETHING,
 DAMN
 IT, I FELT
 IT.
 I KNEW
 THAT
 THINGS
 WEREN'T
 GOING
 TO END
 JUST
 LIKE
 THIS
 - AND
 THAT
 SOMEWHERE
 IN THERE
 WAS
 SOMETHING
 MUCH
 DEEPER,
 BEQUEATHED
 TO US BY FELISTER
 HIMSELF
 - A SOUL
 MIRROR
 THAT
 WE ALL
 HAD
 TO LOOK
 INTO! 
ARLO
 SEEMED TO SENSE
 MY PRESENCE: 
- I NEVER
 REMEMBERED
 YOUR
 NAME,
 HONEST! 
- "MY NAME
 IS ELIZANDER
 BARNAYNE,"
 I RE-INTRODUCED
 MYSELF,
 "BUT
 APPARENTLY
 THE
 EVENING
 IS GOING
 TO BE TOO LONG,
 AND
 THE
 MOON
 LOOKS
 RATHER
 OUT
 OF PLACE
 AGAINST
 THIS
 GLOOMY
 SKY,
 DOESN'T
 IT?" 
- "IT IS THE
 SO-CALLED
 WOLF
 MOON,"
 ADDED
 ARLO,
 WHO
 SURPRISED
 ME WITH
 HIS
 PROFOUND
 KNOWLEDGE.
 "THE
 MAN
 IS WISE
 AND
 STRONG,
 BUT
 ALSO
 WILD.
 ENOUGH
 TIME
 PASSED
 FOR US TO REALIZE
 THAT
 NOTHING
 IN OUR
 JOURNEY
 THUS
 FAR
 WAS
 ACCIDENTAL.
 THE
 DANGERS
 REPEATED
 THEMSELVES,
 BUT
 WE WERE
 CONVINCED
 ENOUGH
 THAT
 WE WERE
 FOLLOWING
 THE
 TRUTH." 

SUCH
 PROFOUND
 WORDS
 FROM
 SUCH
 A YOUNG
 MAN
 DEFINITELY
 SURPRISED
 ME. - "WOLVES
 TRUST
 ONLY
 THE
 MOON WITH
 THEIR
 LONELY
 SOUL,"
 ARLO
 CONTINUED
 THOUGHTFULLY.
 "BUT
 WHICH
 138 
 WORLD
 WILL
 BE ABLE
 TO HOUSE
 IT,
 THE
 MATERIAL,
 THE
 ASTRAL,
 OR THE
 SPIRITUAL?
 SOME
 OF THEM
 WILL
 WANDER
 UTTERLY
 ABANDONED
 FOREVER!" 
I COULDN'T
 MAKE
 SENSE
 OF HIS
 WORDS,
 BUT
 FOR
 THE
 FIRST
 TIME
 I BEGAN
 TO FEEL
 AS IF THE
 PICTURE
 WAS
 COMING
 TOGETHER
 AND
 EVERYTHING
 WAS
 FALLING
 INTO
 PLACE. 
- "LIFE
 CAN
 RARELY
 BE CREATED
 IN AN ASH
 HEAP,"ARLO
 CONTINUED,
 "AND
 WHO
 NEEDS
 IT! IT'S
 ALL
 JUST
 A GIANT
 MOCKERY." 
ZONARA
 WAS
 SOMEWHERE
 IN THE
 RESERVE.
 THERE
 WERE
 OTHER
 PATIENTS,
 AND
 SOME
 OF THE
 INHABITANTS
 HAD
 EXPRESSED
 THE
 HOPE
 THAT
 SHE
 COULD
 HELP
 THEM.
 IT HAD
 BECOME
 PART
 AND
 PARCEL
 OF PEOPLE'S
 CARE
 AND SUFFERING. 
HERE,
 IN THIS
 RESERVE,
 TIME
 SEEMED TO HAVE
 STOOD
 STILL.
 AND
 NO ONE
 SEEMED TO CARE
 ABOUT
 ANYTHING
 OR ANYONE.
 AND
 MAYBE
 THAT'S
 THE
 WAY
 IT WAS
 SUPPOSED
 TO BE!
 I AGREED
 IN MY SOUL
 THAT
 PEOPLE
 INHERENTLY
 DISLIKED
 EACH
 OTHER,
 AND
 IT WAS
 MORE
 THAN
 OBVIOUS.
 LIFE
 WAS
 A DIRTY
 THING,
 NOT
 SOME
 BEAUTIFUL
 COLLECTION
 OF WORDS
 AND
 DEFINITIONS.
 NOT
 THE
 FALSE
 REALITY
 EVERYONE
 TRIED
 TO PUSH
 ON YOU. 

- YOU
 KNOW
 I ACTUALLY
 ISSUED
 A BLUEBIRD,
 AND
 THAT'S
 ALL
 THE
 DEBT
 COLLECTORS
 WERE
 WAITING
 FOR,"
 ARLO
 MUTTERED.
 THEY
 DESCENDED
 ON HIM
 LIKE
 A HERD
 OF RABID
 HYENAS
 WHO
 WANTED
 TO TEAR
 A PIECE
 OUT
 OF HIM
 AND
 THE
 KNOWLEDGE
 HE HAD. 
- "BUT WHY?,"
 SAID
 I WITH
 DIFFICULTY,
 "WHERE
 IS THE
 CATCH?
 YOU
 TOO COULD
 HAVE
 FALLEN
 VICTIM
 TO THEIR
 CRUELTY." 
- "TOO
 MANY
 SUMMERS
 HAVE
 CHANGED,
 AND
 NOW
 I SEE EVERYTHING
 MUCH
 MORE
 CLEARLY,"
 ADDED
 ARLO.
 139 
 "THE
 MEANING
 IN THE
 WORDS
 OF A BLUEBIRD.
 THE
 MEANING
 OF LIFE.
 THE
 MEANING
 OF THE
 "WOLF'S
 SOUL." 

- "BUT
 THE
 "WOLF
 MOON"
 RISES
 IN THE
 WINTER
 SEASON,"
 I PERSISTED.
 "AND
 WE ARRIVED
 HERE
 IN MAY
 OR JUNE.
 HOW
 COULD
 SO MUCH
 TIME
 HAVE
 PASSED?
 WHAT
 HAPPENED?
 HAVE
 WE NOT
 FELT
 THE
 CHANGE
 OF THE
 TIMES!" 
- "IT'S
 SOMETHING
 DIFFERENT,"
 ARLO
 LOOKED
 AT ME WITH
 UNDISGUISED
 IRONY,
 "AND
 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
 YOU
 FEEL
 IT NO WORSE
 THAN
 I DO.
 AND
 WHEN
 THE
 PUZZLE
 IS SET,
 YOU
 WILL SEE FELISTER
'S HERITAGE
 AND
 HIS
 TRUE
 FACE
 PERFECTLY.
 WHAT
 HE WAS
 TRYING
 TO TELL
 US BEFORE
 HE DIED.
 DAMNED
 SOULS
 DON'T
 GET
 A SECOND
 CHANCE
 AND ARE
 DOOMED
 TO WANDER
 ALONE
 FOREVER!" 
WHO
 KNOWS
 WHY
 THIS
 TIME
 HIS
 WORDS
 DIDN'T
 SEEM PARTICULARLY
 FRIGHTENING
 TO ME, BUT
 PERFECTLY
 LOGICAL
 AND
 CONNECTED
 TO MY PERSONAL
 DESTINY! 
ON REFLECTION,
 IN ALL
 MY LIFE
 I HAD
 NEVER
 MET
 ANOTHER
 WHO
 GAVE
 PEOPLE
 A CHANCE
 LIKE
 FELISTER
 - HIMSELF
 REJECTED
 AND
 RIDICULED,
 HE HAD
 SURROUNDED
 HIMSELF
 WITH
 SELF-SERVING
 FREAKS
 WHO
 ONLY
 SAW
 IN HIM
 - NOT
 SO MUCH
 A FRIEND
 OR SPIRITUAL
 TEACHER,
 NOT
 EVEN AN EMPLOYER,
 BUT A LAST
 REFUGE
 IN HIS OWN
 HOPELESSLY
 DOOMED
 LIFE. 
- "THE
 IRONY
 IS THAT
 MOST
 BELIEVE
 IN NONSENSE
 AND
 FOOLISHNESS,"
 ARLO
 SAID
 A LITTLE
 SARCASTICALLY,
 "AND
 THE
 TRUTH
 IS FAR,
 FAR
 TOO
 SIMPLE..." 
COME
 TO THINK
 OF IT,
 THE
 INDIANS
 ON THE
 RESERVATION
 HAD
 EVERYTHING
 THEY
 NEEDED
 TO SURVIVE
 - AT LEAST
 OSTENSIBLY. 
THEY
 HAD
 FREE
 ACCESS
 TO EDUCATION,
 THEY
 HAD
 MONEY,
 THEY
 HAD
 WELL-REGULATED
 HOUSING,
 THEY
 140 
 EVEN HAD
 THE
 RIGHT
 TO GOVERN
 THEMSELVES
 BY THEIR
 OWN
 LAWS
 WITHIN
 THE
 FEDERAL
 STATE! 
AND
 YET... 
WHAT
 ELSE
 WAS
 NEEDED
 FOR LIFE
 TO FLOW
 NORMALL
Y? WHAT
 WAS
 STILL
 LACKING!
 MAYBE
 JUST
 A LITTLE... 

SINGING
 SHADOW
 TURNED
 TO THE
 OTHER
 TRIBE
 MEMBERS
 WITH
 GRATITUDE: 
- THANK
 YOU
 FOR HOSTING
 US ALL
 THESE
 YEARS
 WHEN
 WE NEEDED
 TO BE HONORED.
 MY BLUEBIRD
 SON
 HAS
 HELPED
 YOU
 ENOUGH.
 HE LONGED
 FOR JUSTICE,
 BUT
 NOW
 I SEE THAT
 LIFE
 HAS
 SLIPPED
 AWAY
 FROM
 HIM
 AND
 HE IS BUT
 A PALE
 SEMBLANCE
 OF HIS
 TRUE
 SELF. 
THE
 HOWLING
 OF THE
 COYOTES
 IN THE
 DISTANCE
 SEEMED TO INTENSIFY.
 MAYBE
 THEY
 HADN'T
 SATIATED
 THEIR
 HUNGER.
 BUT
 EVEN IF ONE
 OF THEM
 DID
 ENTER
 THE
 PRESERVE,
 WHICH
 WAS NOT
 ENTIRELY
 OUT
 OF THE
 QUESTION,
 WE WOULD
 SIMPLY
 SHOOT
 IT - FOR
 SUCH
 WAS
 THE
 FATE
 DESERVED
 BY ANY
 FOUL
 DOG
 THAT
 BROKE
 THE
 DAMNED
 RULES
 OF THE
 MORALITY
 OF LIFE
 AND
 ITS NATURAL
 CYCLE! 
BIG
 BROTHER
 LOOKED
 CONCERNED,
 AND
 SPOKE
 QUITE
 AMIABLY
 OF THE
 MERITS
 OF BLUEBIRD,
 WHO
 HAD BEEN
 A TREMENDOUS
 HELP
 TO THE
 TRIBE
 IN THE
 NEARLY
 THIRTY-FIVE
 YEARS
 SINCE
 HE HAD
 FIRST
 COME
 TO MENOMINEE
 TERRITORY.
 BUT
 BIG
 BROTHER
 HAD
 NO REASON
 NOW
 TO SHARE
 THE
 FIVE
 PERCENT
 THAT
 AMOUNTED
 TO HUNDREDS
 OF THOUSANDS
 OF DOLLARS
 A YEAR
 WITH
 HIS
 FELLOW-MORE
 SO AFTER
 ALL
 THAT
 HAD
 HAPPENED
 HERE. 
BROTHERHOOD
 AND
 EQUALITY
 WERE
 RELATIVE
 CONCEPTS
 IN THIS
 WORLD
 OF LONELINESS
 AND
 HOPELESSNESS.
 WHO
 CARED
 ABOUT
 HIS
 FELLOW
 MAN? 
141 
 ARLO
 HAD
 MADE
 A GOOD LIVING,
 BUT
 HE KNEW
 THAT
 SOONER
 OR LATER
 HIS
 COVER
 WOULD
 FALL. 
- "HONOR
 IS A STRETCH
 OF THE
 IMAGINATION.
 EVERYONE
 HERE
 IS LIKE
 HYPNOTIZED,"
 HE TRIED
 TO CONCLUDE
 WISELY,
 AND
 PUT
 THE
 MONEY
 AWAY. 
PERHAPS
 HIS
 MATERIALISTIC
 NATURE
 SIMPLY
 PREVENTED
 HIM
 FROM
 SENSING
 THE
 FINER
 LEVELS
 OF EXISTENCE,
 OR RATHER
 ACCEPTING
 THEM. 
HE HAD SOLD
 NEARLY
 THIRTY
 THOUSAND
 DOLLARS
 WORTH
 OF WEED,
 WHICH
 WAS
 A HUGE
 SUCCESS.
 HE WAS
 CERTAINLY
 MAKING
 A SERIOUS
 PROFIT. 
SOON
 ZONARA
 TURNED
 AROUND
 AND
 CAME
 TO US - ELIZANDER
 BARNAIN
 AND
 ARLO
 - TWO
 COMPLETE
 ANTIPODES
 WHO
 HAD
 TO COOPERATE
 FOR THE
 SAKE
 OF A COMMON
 GOAL.
 I HAD
 HEARD
 ARLO'S
 CONFESSION,
 BUT WAS
 IN NO HURRY TO GIVE
 IT OUT. 
- SOME
 ROCKERS
 WERE
 HANGING
 AROUND
 THE
 RESERVATION
 AND
 MAYBE
 EVEN PEOPLE
 POSING
 AS FEDERAL
 AGENTS
 WHO
 WERE
 PROBABLY
 ON THE
 PAYROLL
 OF THE
 DRUG CARTELS.
 I WASTED
 TOO MUCH TIME
 WITH
 THE
 BLUEBIRD
 TREATMENT.
 BUT
 HE CAN
 STILL
 REVEAL
 TO US EXACTLY
 HOW
 HE TRAVELS
 IN THE
 ASTRAL
 WORLD
 AND
 WHAT
 HELPS
 HIM
 FIND
 THE
 ANSWERS
 TO HIS
 QUESTIONS.
 JUST
 REMEMBER,
 THE
 DEMON
 IS WITH
 HIM
 ALL
 THE
 TIME
 - SO BE CAREFUL!
 HE WILL
 HEAR
 AND
 SEE EVERYTHING
 WHILE
 HERE
 WITH
 HIS
 SOUL
 IN THIS
 RESURRECTION! 
BLUEBIRD
 BEGAN
 TO RECOVER
 QUICKLY,
 AND
 WITH
 HIM
 THE
 DEMON
 HIMSELF
 WAS
 GETTING
 STRONGER
 - SO IT WAS
 NO WONDER
 AT ALL
 THAT
 WE DIDN'T
 FEEL
 THE
 TIME
 PASS
 AND
 BEGIN
 TO WARM
 UP AGAIN. 
WE HAD
 SPENT
 MORE
 THAN
 EIGHT
 MONTHS
 IN THE
 RESERVE,
 DURING
 WHICH
 TIME
 WE HAD
 LEARNED
 FAR
 TOO
 MUCH
 ABOUT
 THE
 LIVES
 OF THE
 NATIVES. 
142 
 BLUEBIRD
 WAS
 NOT
 EXACTLY
 A MEMBER
 OF THE
 TRIBE,
 AS HE ETHNICALLY
 BELONGED
 TO THE
 KAYUGA
 TRIBE,
 BUT ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND,
 THE
 RUMOR
 OF THE
 DEMON
 HAD
 SPIRITUALLY
 SEPARATED
 HIM
 FROM
 HIS
 FELLOWS,
 AND
 IT COULD
 BE SAID
 THAT
 WE,
 HIS
 DISCIPLES,
 WERE
 CLOSER
 TO HIM
 AT THE
 TIME,
 AND
 WE MIGHT
 WELL
 HAVE
 WITNESSED
 HIS
 REPEATED
 DEMISE. 
ACCORDING
 TO THE
 ZONAR'S
 EXPLANATION,
 IF THERE
 WAS
 ONE,
 THE
 DEMON
 WOULD
 MOST
 LIKELY
 CEASE
 TO EXIST
 AT HIS
 NEXT
 RESURRECTION. 
BLUEBIRD
 HAD
 STAYED
 IN THE
 TENT
 TOO LONG,
 BUT
 SOMETIMES
 HE WOULD
 COME
 OUT
 AND
 LOOK AT THE
 SKY
 - AS IF TO SAY
 THAT
 LIFE
 WAS
 HERE
 ON EARTH.
 WE DID
 OUR
 BEST
 TO FEED
 HIM
 WELL,
 AND
 ARLO
 HIMSELF
 HAD
 EVEN SET ASIDE
 SOME
 OF THE MONEY
 FROM
 THE
 GOODS
 WE SOLD,
 WHICH
 HE USED
 TO BUY HIM
 SOME
 SMALL
 PROVISIONS. 
ONCE
 HE WAS
 STRONGER,
 BLUEBIRD
 CALLED
 US AND
 BEGAN
 TO INITIATE
 US INTO
 THE
 ART
 OF TRAVEL
 BETWEEN
 WORLDS.
 HOWEVER,
 HE WARNED
 US THAT
 WE WOULD
 PAY
 FOR IT, MORE
 OR LESS,
 AS WE MIGHT
 ENCOUNTER
 DARK
 ENTITIES
 IN SOME
 OF THE
 WORLDS. 
- "YOU
 WILL
 NEVER
 BE THE
 SAME,
 NOR
 WILL
 YOUR
 LIFE
 AFTER
 THIS,"
 HE MURMURED,
 "AND
 SO WE BEGIN."
 I DON'T
 WANT
 TO OVERLOOK
 THE
 WONDERFUL
 WORK
 OF GUS,
 WHOSE
 TRANSLATION
 SKILLS
 WERE
 SIMPLY
 WONDERFUL
 - HE WAS
 OBVIOUSLY
 FLUENT
 IN SEVERAL
 INDIAN
 DIALECTS
 AND
 DEALT
 WITH
 QUITE
 COMPLEX
 SOCIAL
 CONTRADICTIONS,
 KNOWING
 THE
 CULTURE
 OF THE
 NATIVES. 
GUS
 EXPRESSED
 NO DESIRE
 FOR
 INITIATION
 INTO
 THE
 MYSTERIES
 OF BLUEBIRD,
 BUT
 I NEVER
 ASKED
 HIM
 THE
 REAL
 REASON
 - IT WAS
 HIS
 PERSONAL
 DECISION,
 AFTER
 ALL.
 GUS
 DID,
 HOWEVER,
 AGREE
 TO BE OF ASSISTANCE
 IF ANYTHING
 UNFORESEEN
 HAPPENED. 
143 
 GUS
 EXPRESSED
 NO DESIRE
 FOR
 INITIATION
 INTO
 THE
 MYSTERIES
 OF BLUEBIRDING,
 BUT
 I NEVER
 ASKED
 HIM
 THE
 REAL
 REASON
 - IT WAS
 HIS
 PERSONAL
 DECISION,
 AFTER
 ALL.
 GUS
 DID,
 HOWEVER,
 AGREE
 TO BE OF ASSISTANCE
 IF ANYTHING
 UNFORESEEN
 HAPPENED. 
DURING
 OUR
 TIME
 AT THE
 RESERVE,
 GUS
 WOULD
 POP
 OVER
 TO HIS
 FARM,
 WHICH
 WAS
 A HUGE
 DISTANCE
 AWAY
 IN COLORADO,
 WHERE
 HE HAD
 PICKED
 US UP AND HITCHHIKED.
 HE HAD
 ARRANGED
 FOR HIS
 WIFE
 TO HAVE
 THE
 CARE
 OF THE
 FARM
 PRODUCE,
 AND
 HE DROVE
 THE
 HARVEST,
 HIRING
 WORKERS
 TO OVERRIDE
 HIM
 FOR
 THIS
 PURPOSE,
 BUT
 THROUGH
 VIDEO
 SURVEILLANCE
 HE WAS
 GIVING
 THEM
 SOME
 CONTROL.
 THEY
 WERE
 ALOOF
 AND
 HONEST
 PEOPLE,
 AND
 GENERALLY
 DIDN'T
 STEAL
 FROM
 HIM
 TOO MUCH
 - THAT
 IS,
 THERE
 WAS
 A GASS
 TO BE HAD. SO SOMETIMES
 HE WAS
 ABSENT
 FROM
 THE
 RESERVE
 FOR
 ALL
 TOO
 UNDERSTANDABLE
 REASONS.
 AND
 WE COULDN'T
 BLAME
 HIM
 FOR
 THAT.
 LIFE
 WENT
 ON. 
BLUEBIRD
 WAS
 IN A HURRY TO PASS
 ON THE
 MOST
 IMPORTANT
 PIECE
 OF KNOWLEDGE,
 AS IT WOULD
 HELP
 US GET
 TO OUR
 DESTINATION: 
- ASTRAL
 WORLDS
 ARE
 BUILT
 DIFFERENTLY
 THAN
 OURS,
 AND
 SOMETIMES
 DANGEROUS
 CREATURES
 LURK
 THERE,
 BUT
 THEY
 CAN'T
 HURT
 YOU
 MUCH
 IF YOU
 KNOW
 HOW
 TO DEAL
 WITH
 THEM. 
BLUEBIRD
 SEEMED
 TO SAY
 THIS
 TO REMIND
 US OF THE
 DEMON
 BOUND
 TO HIS
 OWN
 SOUL. 
- UNNATURAL
 INTERRUPTION
 OF LIFE
 CAN
 INDEED
 BE A PROBLEM,
 BUT
 IN THE
 ASTRAL
 WORLDS
 IT IS NOT
 POSSIBLE
 TO DIE
 - AT LEAST
 NOT
 WHILE
 YOU
 ARE
 SOME
 IN THEM.
 IT IS ALSO
 IMPORTANT
 NEVER
 TO FORGET
 THAT
 EACH
 MATERIAL
 BODY
 HAS
 ITS OWN
 ASTRAL
 ENVELOPE
 AND
 THAT
 THE
 PHYSICAL
 MATRIX
 ITSELF
 IS 144 
 LOCATED
 IN THE
 ASTRAL
16. THAT
 IS ENOUGH
 TO BEGIN
 WITH. 

BLUEBIRD'S
 FACE,
 THOUGH
 STILL
 YOUNG,
 LOOKED
 SOMEWHAT
 STRANGELY
 AGED.
 HE PRONOUNCED
 THE
 WORDS
 AS DISTINCTLY
 AND
 SMOOTHLY
 AS IF HE WERE
 SINGING,
 BUT
 WE COULD
 ALL
 SEE CLEARLY
 WHAT
 AN EFFORT
 EACH
 SPOKEN
 WORD
 COST
 HIM.
 PERHAPS
 THE
 DEMON
 WAS
 DRINKING
 FROM
 HIS
 LIFE
 FORCE,
 AS EVERY
 DEMON
 - EVEN ARTIFICIALLY
 CREATED
 ONES
 NEEDED
 TO DO THIS
 TO SURVIVE. 
ARLO
 DECIDED
 TO ASK
 ONE
 MORE
 QUESTION
 THOUGH,
 JUST
 TO BE ABSOLUTELY
 SURE
 BEFORE
 WE TRIED
 TO FIND
 OUR
 ANSWERS: 
- MASTER,
 WHAT
 TYPE
 OF CREATURES
 EXACTLY
 INHABIT
 THIS
 THIN
 WORLD
17? AND
 HOW
 EXACTLY
 SHOULD
 WE BEWARE
 OF THEM? 
- "YOUR
 QUESTION
 IS NOT
 AT ALL
 WITHOUT
 MERIT,"
 A BLUE
 BIRD
 CALLED
 SADLY,
 "IT'S
 NOT
 MUCH
 OF A SECRET
 - THESE
 DIMENSIONS
 ARE
 GENERALLY
 INHABITED
 BY ANGELS,
 DEMONS,
 SUICIDAL
 SOULS
 AND
 ELEMENTALS,
 AND
 SOMETIMES
 EVEN
 GODS." 
ZONARA
 CLEARLY
 HAD
 HIS
 OWN
 OPINION
 ON THE
 MATTER,
 BUT
 DECIDED
 NOT
 TO INTERRUPT
 BLUEBIRD. 
- "THE
 TRICKY
 PART
 IS REALLY
 FINDING
 THE
 ANSWERS
 YOU
 SEEK IN THESE
 UNKNOWN
 WORLDS,"
 HE CONCLUDED,
 "WE'LL
 GET
 STARTED
 ON YOUR
 INITIATION
 SOON,
 AS I HAVE
 A FEELING
 I PROBABLY
 WON'T
 BE LONG.
 THIS
 WINTER
 MAY
 BE MY LAST." 
                                               
 16 The proposed explanations are according to the book Man 
and His Bodies by Annie Besant. 
17 According to some sources, the thin world is a name for th
e 
astral world. 
145 
 LATELY,
 GUS
 HAD
 BEEN
 STOPPING
 BY THE
 RESERVE
 TO MEET
 BLUEBIRD,
 FOR WHOM
 HE HAD
 THE
 UTMOST
 RESPECT.
 THE
 TWO
 OF THEM
 HAD
 STILL
 RETAINED
 THAT
 FRIENDSHIP
 THAT
 MEANT
 SOMETHING
 TO THEM.
 GUS
 ALSO
 SOMETIMES
 BROUGHT
 VEGETABLES
 AND
 FRUIT
 TO HIS
 RESURRECTED
 FRIEND.
 THE
 FARMER
 KNEW
 THAT
 TRUST
 AND
 SUPPORT
 REVEALED
 THE
 TRUE
 FROM
 THE
 FALSE
 COMRADE. 
- "DEAR
 GUS,"
 THE
 RESURRECTED
 ONE
 ADDRESSED
 HIM,
 "THOSE
 WHO
 HAVE
 BEEN
 MORE
 VIRTUOUS
 DEVELOP
 A MORE
 SPECIAL
 INTUITION
 IN THE
 AFTERLIFE." 

- "WOULD
 IT HELP
 THEM?,"
 ASKED
 GUS,
 WHO,
 THOUGH
 UNINITIATED,
 HAD
 SOME
 IDEA
 OF THINGS. 
- "SURELY
 THOSE
 WHO
 HAVE
 LIVED
 BAD
 LIVES
 HAVE
 A MUCH
 HIGHER
 LADDER
 TO CLIMB
 UP TO THEIR
 SPIRITUAL
 PURIFICATION,"
 BLUEBIRD
 WISELY
 CONFIRMED. 

ZONARA
 DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO BOTHER
 THE
 TWO
 FRIENDS
 WHEN
 THEY
 WERE
 HAVING
 SUCH
 IMPORTANT
 CONVERSATIONS
 - ESPECIALLY
 SINCE
 GUS
 SAID
 THAT
 HE PROBABLY
 WOULDN'T
 BE ABLE
 TO MAKE
 IT TO THE
 RESERVE
 ANYTIME
 SOON,
 BUT
 HE PROMISED
 TO SEND
 SOMEONE
 TO CARRY
 BLUEBIRD'S
 FOOD
 PROVISIONS.
 ZONARA
 UNDERSTOOD
 THAT
 THE
 SO-CALLED
 FRIENDSHIP
 BETWEEN
 THEM
 WAS
 MORE
 THAN
 SIMPLE
 INTERACTION,
 AND
 WAS
 BUILT
 ON A SORT
 OF SURVIVAL
 BALANCE. 

- "YOU
 MIGHT
 GET
 IN TROUBLE
 FOR COMING
 HERE
 AND
 HELPING
 ME,"
 THE
 INDIAN
 TURNED
 TO HIM
 SADLY,
 "AFTER
 ALL,
 I CAME
 BACK
 HERE
 ON AN IMPORTANT
 MISSION,
 AND
 THE
 GREAT
 SPIRIT
 WILL
 WEIGH
 MY DEEDS
 AND
 DECIDE
 WHERE
 TO SEND
 MY SOUL." 
GUS
 HAD
 COME
 FOR THE
 LAST
 TIME
 - HE LONGED
 TO GIVE
 SOME
 COMFORT
 TO HIS
 FRIEND,
 BUT
 DID
 NOT
 146 
 KNOW
 WHAT
 TO SAY
 TO HIM
 - THE
 SITUATION
 COULD
 NOT
 BE DESCRIBED
 SO LIGHTLY
 AND
 PLEASANTLY.
 GUS
 SEARCHED
 FOR SOME
 THREAD
 TO HIS
 FORMER
 MATE,
 BUT HIS
 HANDS
 AND
 FACE
 SHOWED
 THE
 SCARS
 OF THE
 DEMON'S
 PRESENCE,
 LURKING
 QUIETLY
 IN THE
 DARKNESS. 

- "I
 WAS
 OF USE
 TO THEM
 AT THE
 TIME,"
 BLUEBIRD
 ALMOST
 CRIED.
 "I
 LONGED
 TO SEE FREEDOM
 AND TO HAVE
 MY SOUL
 SOOTHED.
 SO MANY
 DISAPPOINTMENTS,
 BUT IF THERE
 IS A DOOMSDAY,
 I WILL
 BE OF GOOD
 CONSCIENCE.
 MAY
 THE
 FOUR
 DEITIES
 WHO
 FORM
 THE WAKAN
 TANKA
 REVEAL
 THEIR
 GREAT
 SECRET
 IN THE
 HEREAFTER!" 

- "FRIEND,
 DO NOT
 STRAIN
 YOURSELF,"
 GAS
 TRIED
 TO REASSURE
 HIM,
 "MORE
 OUT
 OF RESPECT
 THAN
 SYMPATHY
 OR AFFECTION.
 THOSE
 TIMES
 ARE
 PAST.
 PERHAPS
 BETTER
 ONES
 WILL
 COME,
 AND
 THE
 WHEEL
 OF HISTORY
18 ..." 
BLUEBIRD
 LOOKED
 AT HIM
 CAREFULLY.
 AND
 SAID
 NOTHING.
 GUS
 PATTED
 HIS
 FRIEND
 ON THE
 SHOULDER
 AND
 WALKED
 OUT.
 HE DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO ADD
 TO HIS
 SUFFERING,
 WHICH
 WAS
 ALREADY
 OBVIOUS.
 HE DIDN'T
 EVEN DARE
 TO ASK
 HOW
 OUR
 PREPARATIONS
 WERE
 GOING,
 AND
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND
 BLUEBIRD
 HAD
 ALSO
 BECOME
 MORE
 CAUTIOUS,
 FOR
 WE WOULD
 BE HIS
 LEGACY
 AND
 HIS
 KNOWLEDGE
 OF THOSE
 HIDDEN
 WORLDS
 WOULD
 LIVE
 ON THROUGH
 US. 
 
CHAPTER
 FIFTEEN:
 THE
 ROCKER
 GANG 
THEN
 SUDDENLY
 THERE
 WAS
 A RUMOR
 THAT
 IN THE
 NEARBY
 KESHENA,
 WHICH
 WAS
 CENTRAL
 TO THE
                                                
 18 The wheel of history is a concept found in Hinduism, 
Sikhism, 
Buddhism, and also in some Native American tribes. 
147 
 MENOMINEE
 RESERVATION
 AND
 WHOSE
 POPULATION
 WAS
 ONLY
 ABOUT
 ONE
 THOUSAND
 TWO
 HUNDRED,
 THERE
 WAS
 A CERTAIN
 ENHAR
 DURAITH
 WHO
 WAS
 ASKING
 TOO
 MANY
 QUESTIONS
 JUST
 FOR
 US-HE DIDN'T
 LOOK
 LIKE
 A GANGSTER,
 OR EXACTLY
 LIKE
 A ROCKER,
 BUT YES HE HAD
 COME
 ON HIS
 HARLEY
 DAVIDSON
 MOTORCYCLE
 AND
 VERY
 NOTICEABLY
 INSPIRED
 SOME
 VAGUE
 SENSE
 OF DANGER
 IN THE
 LOCALS-
HE WAS
 ALL
 ALONE.
 SOME
 OF THOSE
 WHO
 WERE
 CLOSE
 TO THE
 RESERVE
 MANAGEMENT
 WONDERED
 WHETHER
 THEY
 SHOULD
 INFORM
 BIG
 BROTHER,
 OR EVEN THE
 BLUEBIRD
 HIMSELF,
 ALTHOUGH
 IN HIS PRESENT
 STATE
 THEY
 HAD,
 SO TO SPEAK,
 WRITTEN
 HIM
 OFF
 AND
 HAD
 NO HOPE
 OF HIM
 RECOVERING
 TO HIS
 FORMER
 POSITION.
 BUT
 THE
 STRANGER
 RATHER
 UNEXPECTEDLY
 DECLARED
 THAT
 HE WISHED
 TO MEET
 NOT
 THEM
 IN PERSON,
 BUT
 GUS
 BENZOUR,
 OUR
 FAITHFUL
 PROVIDER
 OF PROVISIONS,
 AND
 THE
 MAN
 WITHOUT
 WHOM
 WE SHOULD
 HARDLY
 HAVE
 GOT
 HERE. 
QUITE
 A FEW
 OF THE
 LOCALS
 WERE
 A BIT
 WORRIED
 BECAUSE
 THIS
 WAS
 THE
 FOREIGNER'S
 WAY
 OF TRYING
 TO CIRCUMVENT
 SOME
 OF THE
 UNWRITTEN
 RULES
 FOR ENTERING
 THE
 RESERVE.
 AND
 YET
 SOME
 DARED
 TO PREEMPT
 THE
 GASS. 
THEY
 MET
 ON NEUTRAL
 TERRITORY
 AND
 GUS
 EXPLAINED
 TO THE
 FOREIGNER
 THAT
 IT WAS
 NOT
 CUSTOMARY
 FOR EVERYONE
 TO ENTER
 HERE
 AND
 THERE
 WERE
 SOME
 RESTRICTIONS
 EVEN FOR
 SOME
 PEOPLE
 OF INDIAN
 DESCENT
 WHO
 DID
 NOT
 BELONG
 IN THIS
 AREA.
 OF COURSE,
 GUS
 WASN'T
 LYING
 TOO
 MUCH,
 BUT THE
 WAY
 HE PRESENTED
 HIMSELF
 DIDN'T
 SIT
 WELL
 WITH
 THE
 ENHAR: 
- REMEMBER
 THAT
 SHOW?
 THE
 ONE
 YOU
 HAD
 NO INTENTION
 OF EVEN ATTENDING,
 BUT
 YOU
 WON
 THAT
 RABBIT
 - YOU
 COULD
 TELL
 THAT
 DUREITH
 HAD
 SOMETHING
 SPECIFIC
 IN MIND. 
148 
 GUS
 HAD
 QUITE
 GENTLEMANLY
 OFFERED
 TO BUY
 HIM
 A BEER
 TO CEMENT
 SOME
 FORM
 OF CONVERSATION
 BETWEEN
 THEM. 
- LOOK,
 I MAY
 HAVE
 BEEN
 PART
 OF THE
 BIGGEST
 ROCKER
 GANG
 IN THE
 STATES
19, BUT I CAN
 AT LEAST
 TRUST
 MY EYES
 AND
 WHAT
 YOU
 DID
 TO WIN
 THAT
 DAMN
 ANIMAL
 WAS
 COMPLETELY
 IMPOSSIBLE.
 YOU
 PREDICTED
 THE
 OUTCOME
 IN A WAY
 THAT... 
GUS
 REALIZED
 HE WASN'T
 GOING
 TO BE ABLE
 TO GET
 AWAY
 WITH
 THE
 USUAL
 DODGEBALL,
 BUT
 HE DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO PLAY
 COMPLETELY
 OPEN
 CARDS
 EITHER. 
- "IS
 THERE
 ANYONE
 WITH
 YOU?,"
 HE ASKED
 EVASIVELY,
 THOUGH
 IT WAS
 PROBABLY
 ONLY
 A MATTER
 OF TIME
 BEFORE
 THE
 OTHERS
 ARRIVED,
 OR PERHAPS
 WERE
 LURKING
 ABOUT. 
- "TELL
 ME, MATE,"
 DURAITH
 BEGAN
 RATHER
 POLITELY,
 "CAN'T
 WE WORK
 SOMETHING
 OUT
 AND
 BE INCLUDED
 IN THIS
 SCHEME.
 I DON'T
 MIND
 LOSING
 NEARLY
 FOUR
 HUNDRED
 DOLLARS
 BECAUSE
 OF YOU.
 I'LL
 TREAT
 IT AS AN INITIAL
 INVESTMENT
 IN ..." 
- "IN?," HE MADE
 A FACE,
 BUT HIS
 MIND
 WAS
 WORKING
 FASTER
 THAN
 EVER,
 AND
 HE FELT
 THAT
 HE MIGHT
 BE IN FOR A LIFE AND
 DEATH
 STRUGGLE. 
- "IN THIS,"
 THE
 ROCKER
 TRIED
 TO DESCRIBE
 IT,
 BUT
 COULDN'T
 FIND
 THE
 WORDS
 TO EXPRESS
 HIS
 THOUGHTS. 

- "DO
 YOU
 WANT
 TO HAVE
 THESE
 POWERS
 OR JUST
 MAKE
 MONEY?,"
 GASPED
 GUS. 
HERE
 DUREITH
 WAS
 PUZZLED.
 THE
 HELL'S
 ANGELS
 WERE
 NOT
 ONLY
 THE
 BIGGEST
 GANG
 - THEY
 WERE
 ALSO
 A BAND
 OF OUTLAWS
 LIVING
 ON THE
 FRINGES
 OF                                                
 19 The Hells Angels are meant. 
149 
 SOCIETY
 - AND
 IN MANY
 COUNTRIES
 THEY
 WERE
 OUTLAWED. 

- "I
 SAW
 YOU
 DO THAT
 TRICK,"
 STAMMERED
 DUREITH.
 "TELL
 ME, HOW
 DID
 IT HAPPEN?
 MAYBE
 IT WAS
 SOME
 KIND
 OF MAGIC
 TRICK
 OR MAYBE
 IT WAS
 A TRICK
?," GUS
 LOOKED
 AT HIM
 INTENTLY.
 HE WAS
 ARMED,
 BUT
 NOT
 WITH
 A SMITH
 & WESSON,
 BUT WITH
 A BERETTA
 ARMY
 PISTOL
 THAT
 COULD
 HAVE
 PUT
 THAT
 COCKY
 DULLARD
 ON THE
 SPOT.
 BUT
 THIS
 WASN'T
 THE
 PLACE
 TO USE
 FORCE.
 BTW,
 HE WAS
 FAMILIAR
 WITH
 THE
 SUBCULTURE
 OF ROCKER
 GANGS
 - ESPECIALLY
 THIS
 ONE,
 SINCE
 MUCH
 SMALLER
 GROUPS
 HAD
 TO REPORT
 TO IT,
 AND
 THAT
 IN TURN
 GAVE
 RISE
 TO OBLIGATORY
 CONFLICTS. 
BUT IT SEEMS
 DWIGHT
 WAS
 A LOT SMARTER
 THAN
 ANY
 AVERAGE
 ROCKER: 
- LOOK,
 I DON'T
 WANT
 TO CAUSE
 TROUBLE.
 NOT
 EVEN
 FOR MY FOUR
 HUNDRED
 BUCKS.
 CAN'T
 I JOIN
 YOU?
 I'M
 NOT
 PART
 OF THAT
 GANG
 ANYMORE. 
GUS
 CONTINUED
 TO STARE
 AT HIM
 INTENTLY
 - OBVIOUSLY
 EXPECTING
 TO HEAR
 SOMETHING
 ELSE. 
- "LISTEN,
 MAN,"
 HE SAID,
 JUST
 A LITTLE
 SOFTER,
 "YOU
 KNOW
 WHAT
 IT'S
 LIKE
 TO SPEND
 ALL
 THAT
 TIME
 IN A FEDERAL
 PRISON
 - IN AN ISOLATION
 CELL
 BETWEEN
 FOUR
 WALLS
 WHERE
 YOU
 CAN
 HEAR
 NOTHING
 BUT
 YOUR
 OWN
 BREATHING.
 DO YOU
 KNOW
 WHAT
 IT'S
 LIKE
 NOT
 TO BE ABLE
 TO FIND
 A PLACE
 FOR YOURSELF
 ALL
 OVER
 THE
 GODDAMN
 STATES?
 AND
 YOU
 END
 UP EXPECTING
 TO WIN
 A BUCK IN A COUNTRY
 RACE..." 
- "I
 KNOW
 WHAT
 YOU'RE
 TALKING
 ABOUT,"
 GASPED
 THE
 GUY,
 "YOU'RE
 FROM
 ADX
 IN THE
 STATE
 OF COLORADO?
 THIS
 "ALCATRAZ
 OF THE
 ROCKY
 MOUNTAINS"
 AIN'T
 A NICE
 PLACE,
 EH?
 THERE'S
 NO OTHER
 WAY
 OUT
 THEN,
 IS THERE?
 EXCEPT
 ..." 
150 
 DURAITH
'S HAIR
 BRISTLED.
 HIS
 ROCKER
 BRAID
 AND
 DECORATIVE
 PLATINUM
 EARRING
 DEFINITELY
 ADDED
 COLOR
 TO HIS
 CHARACTER,
 BUT BENEATH
 HIS
 BAND
 HE WAS
 SWEATING. 
- HOW
 THE
 HELL
 DO YOU
 KNOW
 ALL
 THIS?
 AND
 ... - "LET
 ME ASK
 YOU
 SOMETHING,
 BUDDY.
 WHO
 DO YOU
 THINK
 HELPED
 YOU
 GET
 OUT
 OF SOLITARY
 CONFINEMENT,
 WHERE
 THEY
 SOMETIMES
 SEND
 THEM
 DIRECTLY
 YOU
 KNOW
 WHERE?,"
 MUTTERED
 GUS
 QUIETLY. 

AS ROASTED
 AS HE WAS,
 THE
 ROCKER
 REALISED
 THAT
 HE WAS
 NO ORDINARY
 MAN
 STANDING
 OPPOSITE
 HIM. 
GUS
 BENZOUR
'S SAD
 BLUE
 EYES CAST
 LIGHTNING,
 BUT
 THEY
 WERE
 GENTLE
 AND
 CALM. 
DURAITH
 WOULD
 HAVE
 SWALLOWED
 HIS
 TONGUE
 BEHIND
 HIS
 TEETH. 
- "DID
 YOU
 DRAG
 ME INTO
 THE
 GANG
 TOO
?," HE SAID
 IN AN INHUMAN
 VOICE. 
GUS
 NODDED
 AFFIRMATIVELY. 
- "BUT
 WHY?
 APPARENTLY
 YOU
 NEEDED
 ME?
 I'M
 OBVIOUSLY
 PART
 OF SOME
 SCHEME
 OF YOURS?
 TELL
 ME! SPEAK!,"
 HE UTTERED,
 ALMOST
 BESIDE
 HIMSELF. 
HE HAD
 THE
 FEELING
 THAT
 HIS
 EYES WERE
 GLAZING
 OVER
 AND
 THAT
 HE WAS
 GOING
 TO COLLAPSE
 TO THE
 GROUND,
 WHERE
 HE WOULD
 NEVER
 GET
 UP AGAIN. 
- "SEE, COWBOY,
 YOU'RE
 IN THE
 SACRED
 LAND
 OF THE
 SPIRITS,"
 GASPED
 GUS,
 "AND
 THEY'VE
 BEEN
 HERE
 LONG BEFORE
 YOU
 AND
 I BOTH
 SHOWED
 UP.
 DRAW
 HUMILITY
 AND
 YOU
 MAY
 GET
 THE
 ANSWERS
 TO YOUR
 QUESTIONS." 
151 
 DURAITH
 NEEDED
 NO FURTHER
 PERSUASION
 - HE WONDERED
 IF HE'D
 ATTACK
 GUS,
 BUT
 HIS
 BLUE
 EYES MADE
 HIM
 UNCOMFORTABLE
 - HE HADN'T
 SEEN
 THE
 LIKE.
 SOME
 SIMPLE
 FARMER
 - EVEN IF HE WAS
 GOOD
 AT HIS
 JOB
 - TO HOLD
 HIS
 TONGUE
 LIKE
 THAT
 DESERVED
 TO HAVE
 HIM
 DRAGGED
 ALL
 THE
 WAY
 TO COLORADO
 ON HIS
 BIKE,
 AND
 WHY
 NOT
 CASTRATE
 HIM
 AFTER
 HE COLDLY
 BLEW
 HIS
 BRAINS
 OUT
 WITH
 HIS
 MAVERICK
 PUMP
 SHOTGUN
 THAT
 HUNG HOOKED
 IN A SPECIAL
 LEATHER
 CASE
 ON THE
 SIDE
 OF HIS
 BIKE,
 AND
 THEN
 GOUGED
 OUT
 HIS
 EYES
 WITH
 HIS
 HUNTING
 KNIFE,
 ENJOYING
 THE
 POWER
 LAWLESSNESS
 GAVE
 HIM. 
WITNESSES
 TO THE
 LESS
 THAN
 PRETTY
 SCENE
 HAD GATHERED
 AROUND,
 BUT
 DURAITH
 HAD
 TO ADMIT
 HE SENSED
 SOMETHING
 HE COULDN'T
 EXPLAIN.
 IT WAS
 AS IF AN INVISIBLE
 HAND
 OR CREATURE
 - FAR
 MORE
 POWERFUL
 THAN
 ANYTHING
 HIS
 IMAGINATION
 COULD
 HAVE
 SPAWNED
 - COULD
 GRAB
 HIM
 AT ANY
 MOMENT
 AND
 THAT
 WOULD
 BE THE
 END
 OF HIM. 
- "IT WAS
 A PITY
 THAT
 WHILE
 HE WAS
 IN SOLITARY
 CONFINEMENT
 HE DID
 NOT
 UTTER
 A WORD
 OF PRAYER.
 DID
 NOT
 ASK
 FOR FORGIVENESS,"
 GUS
 CONTINUED
 QUIETLY,
 "PERHAPS
 YOUR
 VOICE
 WOULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 HEARD.
 THE
 THICK
 METAL
 DOORS
 STOPPED
 EVERY
 SOUND
 - SO YOU
 COULD
 BE ALONE
 WITH
 YOURSELF
 AND
 ADMIT
 THE
 TRUTH
 YOU
 WERE
 TRYING
 TO ESCAPE
 AND
 TURN
 YOUR
 HEAD
 AWAY
 FROM." 
DURAITH
 HAD
 SPENT
 ENOUGH
 TIME
 IN ROCK
 GANGS
 AS A WAY
 TO SURVIVE,
 KNOWING
 THAT
 SOONER
 OR LATER
 HE WOULD
 HAVE
 TO PAY
 FOR HIS
 SINS
 - THE
 LEADERS
 OF SUCH
 GROUPS
 SOMETIMES
 DIDN'T
 LIVE
 LONG
 AND
 THE
 WHOLE
 GROUP
 INDULGED
 IN VIOLENCE
 AND
 LOOTING,
 SOWING
 DISORDER
 IN THEIR
 PATH. 
SOMETIMES
 THERE
 WERE
 MASS
 SHOOTINGS
 BETWEEN
 GANG
 MEMBERS
 - AND
 THE
 POLICE
 COULDN'T
 EVEN ISSUE
 CONVICTIONS. 
152 
 DURAITH
 WASN'T
 ALONE
 - OH,
 NO,
 BUT
 THE
 OTHER
 GANG
 MEMBERS
 WERE
 A BIT
 MORE
 BEHIND
 AND
 HAD
 EVEN BUILT
 A CONVENIENT
 COVER.
 THEY
 WERE
 EXPECTED
 TO BURST
 IN AT A GIVEN
 SIGN
 AND
 THE
 ACTION
 WOULD
 BEGIN.
 ONLY,
 DURAITH
 GAVE
 ABSOLUTELY
 NO SIGN. 
MANY
 PEOPLE
 THOUGHT
 OF THE
 ROCKERS
 AS KIND
 OF DUMB
 THUGS,
 BUT
 LITTLE
 BY LITTLE
 THEY
 NOTICED
 THE
 IRON
 MONOPOLY
 RULES
 ENFORCED
 BY THE
 GANG
 MEMBERS
 - SOME
 OF THEM
 RAN
 BUILT
 A REAL
 MONEY
 MACHINE. 

WHEN
 DURAITH
 HAD
 JOINED
 THE
 HELL'S
 ANGELS
 GANG,
 SOME
 SAID
 IT WAS
 IN A PERIOD
 OF DECLINE.
 HE MIGHT
 AS WELL
 HAVE
 JOINED
 THE
 SONS
 OF SILENCE,
 WHO
 WERE
 FAMOUS
 FOR THEIR
 HUGE
 STOCKPILES
 OF WEAPONS,
 WITH
 WHICH
 THEY
 STRUCK
 FEAR
 FAR
 AND
 WIDE,
 BUT THE
 REASON
 HE WENT
 TO THE
 HELL'S
 ANGELS
 WAS
 SIMPLE
 - NO ONE
 ASKED
 HIM
 WHERE
 HE WAS
 FROM. 
ONLY
 THAT
 LEFT
 ONE
 QUESTION
 OPEN?
 HOW
 THE
 HELL
 HAD
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 GOT HIM
 OUT
 OF THAT
 HELL
 IN ADX? 
THE
 FEDERAL
 PENITENTIARY
 IN COLORADO
 HAD
 A REPUTATION
 FOR BEING
 THE
 HIGHEST
 SECURITY
 IN THE
 U.S.
 IN A PRISON
 OF THAT
 RANK,
 THE
 SO-CALLED
 ADMINISTRATIVE
 MAXIMUM
 WAS
 IN EFFECT
 - IN SIMPLE
 TERMS,
 THE
 WAY
 OUT
 WAS
 USUALLY
 TO THE
 GRAVE
 OR TO TRANSFER
 TO ANOTHER
 CORRECTIONAL
 INSTITUTION.
 BUT
 THERE
 WERE
 PRECEDENTS
 - IN CASES
 OF SIGNIFICANT
 COOPERATION
 WITH
 THE
 AUTHORITIES. 
- BETWEEN
 THE
 FACT
 THAT
 THIS
 PRISON
 WAS
 BUILT
 FOR
 PRISONERS
 WHO
 WERE
 UNABLE
 TO ADAPT
 IN OTHER
 PRISONS.
 'NO
 ONE
 HAS
 EVER ESCAPED
 FROM
 ADX.'
 MURMURED
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 QUIETLY.
 'NO
 ONE!
 ESPECIALLY
 SINCE
 YOU
 STAYED
 FOR A WHILE
 IN THE
 ULTRA-SECURE
 AND ISOLATED
 "SQUAD
 13" WING.
 YOU
 153 
 WERE
 UNDER
 SPECIAL
 ADMINISTRATIVE
 MEASURES
 AS YOU
 WERE
 ONE
 OF THE
 DANGEROUS
 SPECIAL
 STATUS
 PRISONERS.
 SOME
 LOST
 THEIR
 MINDS,
 OTHERS
 COMMITTED
 SUICIDE,
 AND
 SOME,
 IN A STATE
 OF INDESCRIBABLE
 TERROR
 AND
 SUFFERING,
 CLIMBED
 THE
 WALLS.
 SOME
 EVEN HEARD
 THE
 VOICES
 OF THEIR
 INNER
 DEMONS.
 YOU
 MANAGED
 TO PROTECT
 YOURSELF
 SOMEHOW.
 BUT
 WAS
 IT AN ACCIDENT? 
- "ARE
 YOU
 SAYING
 THAT
 EVERY
 DETAIL
 OF OUR
 ESCAPE
 FROM
 THE
 PRISON
 WAS
 PLANNED
 BY YOU
?," ASKED
 A COMPLETELY
 DISBELIEVING
 DWIGHT. 
- IT DIDN'T
 HAPPEN
 WITHOUT
 YOUR
 INVOLVEMENT
 AND
 PERSONAL
 DESIRE.
 IN YOUR
 SOUL
 YOU
 WANTED
 TO BREAK
 OUT
 - LIKE
 A CAGED
 TIGER,
 AND
 THAT
 UNLOCKS
 SPECIAL
 POWERS
 AND
 ENERGIES.
 MOST
 PEOPLE
 DON'T
 BELIEVE
 IN SUCH
 NONSENSE,
 BUT
 THE
 IMPASSE
 MADE
 YOU
 CLING
 TO ANYTHING
 THAT
 COULD
 HELP
 YOU.
 THEN
 THE
 GUARDS
 STARTED
 LOOKING
 AT YOU
 WITH
 DIFFERENT
 EYES AND
 YOU
 GOT
 A DIFFERENT
 ATTITUDE.
 YOUR
 GOOD
 BEHAVIOUR
 ALLOWED
 YOU
 TO BE MOVED
 TO WINGS
 WITH
 LESS
 SUPERVISION,
 AND
 YOU
 WERE
 SUBSEQUENTLY
 TRANSFERRED
 TO ANOTHER
 PRISON
 TO BE - "BUT HOW
 DID
 I SHED
 MY SKIN
?," ASKED
 DUREITH
 IN A SHAKY
 VOICE. 
GUS
 BENZOUR
 LAUGHED
 WITH
 A SMALL
 BUT
 FRIGHTENING
 SMILE: 
- WELL,
 REALLY,
 DID
 YOU
 WANT
 TO KILL
 US? 
PERHAPS
 DURAITH
 WOULD
 HAVE
 EATEN
 HIM
 ALIVE,
 BUT
 UPON
 REFLECTION,
 HE REALIZED
 THAT
 THE
 COINCIDENCE
 WAS
 SO UNUSUAL
 AS TO BE NATURAL. 
- "SO I OWE
 YOU
 MY LIFE
?," HE TRIED
 TO CLARIFY
 THE
 SITUATION. 
154 
 - NOT
 EXACTLY.
 BUT
 YET
 HERE
 YOU
 ARE
 ... AND
 YOU
 SEE THE
 LIGHT
 THAT
 MANY
 MAY
 NEVER
 SEE AGAIN.
 AND
 THAT'S
 SOMETHING
 - AND
 NOT
 AN UNIMPORTANT
 THING.
 THE
 ROCKER
 GROUP
 PROVIDED
 YOU
 WITH
 COVER
 AND
 GAVE
 YOU
 AN OUTLET
 FOR
 YOUR
 TALENT
 - TO SOW
 TERROR. 

- "BUT
 HOW
 DID
 I GET
 OUT
?," WONDERED
 DURAITH,
 "HOW
 WAS
 MY TRANSFER
 ARRANGED? 
GUS
 LIT
 A CIGARETTE
 - AND
 THIS
 GESTURE
 FINALLY
 CONFUSED
 DURAITH.
 THE
 SMOKE
 DRIFTED
 THROUGH
 THE
 AIR
 WITH
 AN ALMOST
 MAGICAL
 MOTION. 
- "THERE'S
 THE
 ANSWER,"
 WHISPERED
 DUREITH,
 "SO IT REALLY..." 

THE
 ROCKERS,
 WHO
 WERE
 STANDING
 IN AMBUSH,
 DID
 NOT
 INTEND
 TO WAIT
 TOO
 LONG,
 FOR
 THEY
 HAD
 A HUNCH THAT
 THEY
 MIGHT
 FIND
 SOMETHING
 IN THE
 VICINITY
 - IF NOT
 MONEY,
 AT LEAST
 SOME
 NICE
 CLOTHES,
 VALUABLES
 AND
 SO ON,
 WHICH
 THE
 LOOTERS
 COULD
 EASILY
 TURN
 INTO
 MONEY
 AGAIN.
  INCIDENTALLY,
 SOME
 OF THE
 MORE
 INTERESTING
 INDIAN
 ARTIFACTS
 COULD
 BE WORTH
 PLENTY,
 TOO,
 AND
 THE
 BANDITS
 WEREN'T
 PICKING
 UP QUITE
 AS MUCH. 

BUT ONE
 OF THE
 GANG
 LEADERS
 HAD
 GUESSED
 THAT
 MAYBE
 THE
 REAL
 KICKER
 WOULD
 BE THE
 TURNOVER
 OF THE
 CASINO
 AND
 SURROUNDING
 FACILITIES.
 THE
 OTHER
 MEMBERS
 WERE
 IN A WILD
 BARBARIC
 RAPTURE
 - LIKE
 A PACK
 OF JACKALS
 AWAITING
 THEIR
 FEAST.
 INDIAN
 CASINOS
 WERE
 A VERITABLE
 GOLD
 MINE
 FOR THOSE
 LOOTERS
 WHO
 CRAVED
 TO GET
 REAL
 LOOT
 WITH
 ALMOST
 MINIMAL
 EFFORT
 - WELL,
 SURE,
 THERE
 WOULD
 BE A SHOOTOUT,
 BUT
 SO WHAT? 
GUS
 BENZOUR,
 HOWEVER,
 MADE
 THE
 SIGN
 OF A DURAITH: 
155 
 - TELL
 YOUR
 HIDDEN
 BUDDIES
 THAT
 IF THEY
 PUSH
 THE
 CASINO
 AND
 EVEN ONE
 HAIR
 FALLS
 OFF
 THE
 LOCA
LS HEAD
 - THEY
 WON'T
 GET
 OUT
 OF HERE
 ALIVE.
 AND
 REMEMBER
 - YOU
 CHOOSE
 YOUR
 OWN
 PATH...
 WHAT
 DO YOU
 DECIDE? 
THE
 ROCKER
 WAS
 DOUBTING
 HIMSELF
 - THIS
 WAS
 NO JOKE
 AND
 HE HAD
 TO GIVE
 A QUICK
 SIGNAL
 TO HIS
 OWN.
 THERE
 WAS
 NO AVOIDING
 THE
 CONFLICT
 WITH THE
 OTHER
 MEMBERS
 OF THE
 GANG,
 WHO
 WERE
 EXPECTING
 TO CARRY
 OUT
 A SERIOUS
 ROBBERY
 AND
 ENJOY
 THE
 VIOLENCE
 AGAINST
 THE
 LOCALS.
 AND
 BENZOUR
'S BLUE
 EYES WERE
 BURNING
 HIM... 
HE FINALLY
 GAVE
 IN: 
- "BUT
 IF I DON'T
 GIVE
 THEM
 SOMETHING,
 THEY'LL
 KILL
 ME,"
 DURAITH
 REPLIED
 GRIMLY. 
- DON'T
 BOTHER.
 THE
 FORCES
 I SERVE
 AND
 REPRESENT
 WILL
 MAKE
 IT UP TO YOU,
 AND
 SO WILL
 YOUR
 FRIENDS.
 BUT YOU
 MUST
 FOLLOW
 THE
 RULES. 
NOW
 IT REALLY
 DAWNED
 ON DURAITH. 
AT THE
 GIVEN
 SIGNAL
 THE
 ROCKERS
 BEGAN
 TO RETREAT
 THOUGH
 THEIR
 SAVAGE
 INSTINCTS
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 CAUSED
 THEM
 TO RETURN
 AND
 SCORCH
 THE
 PLACE
 A LITTLE LATER.
 SOME
 TIME
 PASSED.
 BUT THEY
 DIDN'T.
 THEY
 HAD
 A REAL
 DESIRE
 TO COMPREHEND
 THAT
 SOME
 UNSEEN
 FORCE,
 WAS
 LOOMING
 OVER
 THEM. 
WILLIE
 ELLAR
 WAS
 THE
 SECOND
 LEADER
 OF THE
 GANG,
 AND
 WAS
 NOT
 AT ALL
 PLEASED
 THAT
 THEY
 HAD
 MISSED
 SUCH
 A CHANCE.
 BUT HE WAS
 ALSO
 AWARE
 THAT
 DWIGHT
 WASN'T
 GOING
 TO GIVE
 THEM
 THE
 SIGNAL
 JUST
 LIKE
 THAT. 
MAYBE
 THEY
 SHOULD
 HAVE
 JUST
 SHOT
 THAT
 PARTICULAR
 FARMER
 WHO
 WAS
 SWEET-TALKING
 DURAITH. 
156 
 EACH
 OF THE
 ROCKERS
 HAD
 A PISTOL,
 AND
 MOST
 HAD
 MAVERICK
 PUMP-ACTION
 SHOTGUNS.
 THEY
 COULD
 HAVE
 EASILY
 WRECKED
 THAT
 PLACE
 BEFORE
 THE
 STATE
 POLICE
 GOT
 AROUND
 TO INVESTIGATING
 EXACTLY
 WHAT
 HAD
 HAPPENED.
 AND
 THEY
 WOULD
 HARDLY
 HAVE
 BEEN
 CRIMINALLY
 LIABLE
 ANYWAY.
 BUT
 ELLAR
 WONDERED
 WHAT
 HAD
 CAUSED
 DURAITH
 TO ACT THE
 WAY
 HE DID. 
WILLIE
 ELLAR
 WAS
 ABOUT
 FIFTY-FIVE
 - WITH
 THE
 LOOKS
 OF A DASHING
 COWBOY,
 A REAL
 WOMAN-BREAKER,
 A PROEDOH
 BY BIRTH,
 A PARTY-GOER
 AT HEART,
 AND
 AN EXCELLENT
 HAND-
TO-HAND
 COMBAT
 AND
 WEAPON-
HANDLING
 EXPERT.
 HE WAS
 TRULY
 AN ACCOMPLISHED
 STREET
 SOLDIER. 
THE
 ROCKERS
 RETIRED
 AND
 MADE
 A SORT
 OF BIVOUAC
 FIFTEEN
 MILES
 FROM
 THE
 KESHENA,
 TAKING
 CARE NOT
 TO BE TOO CONSPICUOUS
 FOR
 THE
 FIRST
 TIME. 
GUS
 HAD
 INSTRUCTED
 DURAITH
 THAT
 IF THEY
 JOINED
 IN THE
 ADVENTURE,
 THEY
 MIGHT
 BE ABLE
 TO GAIN
 SOMETHING
 OF FELISTER
'S LEGACY. 
THE
 ENHAR
 DURAITH
 DIDN'T
 SEEM PARTICULARLY
 PLEASED,
 BUT
 THEN
 AGAIN,
 HIS
 MIRACULOUS
 DELIVERANCE
 GAVE
 HIM
 SOME
 REASON
 TO AT LEAST
 ASSUME
 THAT
 THE
 GHASS
 POSSESSED
 POWERS
 BEYOND
 ORDINARY
 HUMAN
 CAPABILITIES. 
- 'YOU'LL
 HAVE
 YOUR
 ANSWERS
 SOON
 ENOUGH,'
 GAS
 PROMISED
 HIM,
 'BUT
 YOUR
 FRIENDS
 SHOULD
 HELP
 ME TOO,
 OR AT LEAST
 GIVE
 IT A TRY. 
DURAITH
 CLIMBED
 ONTO
 THE
 BIKE
 AND
 PULLED
 AWAY.
 HE WAS
 ABOUT
 TO TELL
 THE
 SHABBY
 STORY
 OF ELER,
 WHO
 COULD
 EVEN FIND
 HIMSELF
 HANGED
 FOR
 NOT
 SHOWING
 ENOUGH
 MANLINESS
 - AS
 THE
 REPRESENTATIVES
 OF THIS
 BREAKAWAY
 FROM
 THE
 SOCIAL
 NORMS
 AND
 LAWS
 ROCKERS
 GANG
 UNDERSTOOD
 IT. 
157 
 PERHAPS
 A QUARTER
 OF AN HOUR
 PASSED
 BEFORE
 DURAITH
 ARRIVED
 AT THE
 BIVOUAC
 OF HIS
 FELLOWS.
 THE
 ROCKERS
 HAD
 BUILT
 A FIRE
 AND
 HAD
 STOLEN
 SOME
 LAMB
 FROM
 A NEARBY
 FARM,
 AND
 NOW
 THEY
 WERE
 WILLINGLY
 PICKING
 AT THE
 CARRION,
 ENJOYING
 EVERY
 BIT
 OF WHAT
 THEY
 HAD
 CAPTURED. 
AS HE DROVE
 LIKE
 A MADMAN
 TO THE
 BIVOUAC,
 DWIGHT
 HAD
 THE
 FEELING
 THAT
 SOME
 PERVERTED,
 INVISIBLE,
 UNCLEAN
 CREATURE
 HAD
 TOUCHED
 THE
 COLD
 MUZZLE
 OF A REVOLVER
 TO HIS
 TEMPLE,
 NOT
 TO PRODUCE
 A DEADLY
 SHOT,
 BUT
 TO REMEMBER
 THE
 ORDER
 OF BENZOUR,
 WHO
 HAD
 HIRED
 HIMSELF
 TO COMPENSATE
 THEM
 IN SOME-NOT
 YET
 QUITE
 DEFINITE-WAY. 
IT HAD
 BEGUN
 TO GET
 DARK
 AND
 THE
 GRASSES
 AROUND
 LOOKED
 LIKE
 SOME
 KIND
 OF UNCLEAN
 GHOSTS
 CASTING
 BLACKISH-BLUISH-GREEN
 SHADOWS.
  ELLER
 GREETED
 THE
 SECOND
 GANG
 LEADER
 NOT
 IN A GOOD
 MOOD,
 BUT
 STRANGE
 AS IT WAS,
 HE WAS
 IN NO HURRY TO ATTACK
 HIM
 OR ASK
 THE
 FIRST
 QUESTION
 - JUST
 MEASURING
 HIM
 WITH
 A LOOK
 OF THE
 MOST
 CARING
 KIND.
 THE
 REST
 OF THE
 MOTORCYCLE
 THUGS
 WERE
 PICKING
 THEIR
 TEETH
 AT THE
 DELICIOUS
 CHUNKS
 OF LAMB,
 AND
 SOME
 HAD
 EVEN TAKEN
 TO COOKING
 THEMSELVES
 A LOVELY
 LAMB
 STEAK,
 AS THEY
 COULD
 AT LEAST
 REST
 FOR AN HOUR
 OR TWO
 BEFORE
 FINALLY
 DECIDING
 WHAT
 TO DO. 
THEY
 DIDN'T
 SEEM
 TO PAY
 ANY
 ATTENTION
 TO DURAITH,
 BUT IN REALITY
 THERE
 WAS
 A WILD
 RAGE
 RAGING
 IN THEIR
 SOULS
 AT BEING
 MADE
 FOOLS
 OF - THEY
 WERE
 LIKE
 BLIND
 MEN WHO
 WANTED
 TO LEARN
 SOMETHING
 IMPORTANT,
 AND
 DURAITH
 WAS
 THEIR
 MESSENGER. 
ELLER
 WAS
 DRINKING
 WATER
 FROM
 SOME
 SORT
 OF TUBE
 - LIKE
 A REAL
 "DEGREE
 WOLF"
 AS SOME
 MEMBERS
 OF THE
 GANG
 WERE
 SOMETIMES
 JOKINGLY
 158 
 CALLED.
 HE THEN
 SET
 ABOUT
 THOROUGHLY
 WASHING
 HIMSELF
 OF ALL
 THE
 SMOKE
 HE HAD
 COLLECTED
 ALONG
 THE
 WAY. 
INCIDENTALLY,
 THE
 GANG'S
 RIDES
 WERE
 OF A WIDE
 VARIETY
 OF BRANDS,
 FROM
 HARLEY
 DAVIDSON
 TO KAWASAKI
 AND
 EVEN ROYAL
 EAGLE.
 IN GENERAL,
 THERE
 WERE
 SOME
 REAL
 CONNOISSEURS
 AMONG
 THE
 GANG
 MEMBERS,
 AS THEIR
 IRON
 HORSES
 CRISS-
CROSSED
 THE
 UNITED
 STATES
 FAR
 AND
 WIDE,
 GIVING
 THEM
 THE
 OPPORTUNITY
 TO GET
 AWAY
 QUICKLY
 AND
 SAFELY
 FROM
 POSSIBLE
 PURSUIT
 BY THE AUTHORITIES. 
ROCKERS
 USUALLY
 DRANK
 HARD
 - ESPECIALLY
 AFTER
 CARRYING
 OUT
 SOME
 MORE
 SERIOUS
 POGROM.
 BUT
 ELLER
 HAD ISSUED
 ORDERS
 FOR THEM
 TO BE AS SOBER
 AS A HIGH
 SCHOOL
 GIRL
 IF THEY
 WANTED
 A PIECE
 OF THE
 PIE. 
WHEN
 DURAITH
 APPROACHED
 AND
 BEGAN
 TO EXPLAIN
 GUS
 BENZOUR
'S REQUEST,
 ELLER
 LISTENED
 TO HIM
 CAREFULLY
 - WITHOUT
 DROPPING
 THE
 USUAL
 PROFANITIES
 AND
 THREATS
 THAT
 THOSE
 BASTARDS
 WOULD
 PAY. 
THEN
 SAID
 TO HIM
 THOUGHTFULLY: 
- "UNLIKE
 US,
 WHO
 COULD
 BE LEFT
 AS DOGS
 IN THE
 ROAD,
 KILLED
 IN SOME
 RANDOM
 GUNFIGHT
 AND NO ONE
 WOULD
 REMEMBER
 US,
 THE
 INDIANS
 TAKE
 CARE OF THEIR
 DEAD,"
 HE POINTED
 WITH
 HIS
 HAND
 INTO
 THE
 DARKNESS,
 "THERE
 IS AN INDIAN
 CEMETERY
 NOT
 FAR
 FROM
 HERE.
 DO YOU
 KNOW
 WHAT
 THE
 NATIVES
 SAY?
 THE
 SHAWNEE
 AND HURON
 INDIAN
 CEMETERIES
 IN KANSAS
 ARE
 EXAMPLES
 OF
 THIS,
 AND
 WE'RE
 JUST
 WAITING
 FOR A BULLET
 IN THE
 FOREHEAD!" 
AFTER
 STARING
 INTO
 THE
 TWILIGHT,
 FROM
 WHICH
 EVERYTHING
 SEEMED
 ABLE
 TO CRAWL,
 HE CUT OFF: 
159 
 - YOUR
 FRIEND
 HAS
 A REALLY
 UNUSUAL
 PROPOSITION,
 BUT WHAT
 THE
 HECK,
 THE
 LOOT
 MIGHT
 BE GOOD.
 I'VE
 HEARD
 THAT
 THE
 OLD FELISTER
 WAS
 A RATHER
 SINISTER
 AND
 BRUTAL
 SORT.
 I'VE
 ALSO
 HEARD
 ABOUT
 THE
 POLICE
 RAID
 ON HIS
 FARM.
 YEAH,
 APPARENTLY
 IT'S
 ALL
 BLOODY
 WEIRD? 
ELLER
 WAVED
 A HAND
 AT DURAITH
 SINCE
 DURAITH
 WAS
 MORE
 SENIOR
 THAN
 HIM: 
- LET'S
 GET
 BACK
 TO THE
 OTHERS!
 WE'LL
 HEAR
 THEIR
 OPINION
 TOO. 
THE
 GROUP
 HAD
 EATEN
 THE
 DELICIOUS
 LAMB,
 AND
 SOME
 OF ITS
 MEMBERS
 HAD
 LIT
 A CACHAQUE
 TO PASS
 THE
 TIME. 
AFTER
 A BRIEF
 CONVERSATION
 BETWEEN
 THEM,
 THE
 TWO
 HAD
 LAID
 OUT
 THEIR
 PROPOSED
 GASSES,
 WHICH,
 THOUGH
 UNUSUAL,
 ATTRACTED
 THEIR
 ATTENTION. 
- "FUCK
 HIM,"
 ROARED
 A STOUT
 FAT
 MAN,
 "WE'RE
 FROM
 HELL,
 AND
 IF FELISTER
 ISN'T
 AN EXAMPLE
 OF SOMEONE
 WHO'S
 BEEN
 IN CONTACT
 WITH
 HELL,
 I DON'T
 KNOW
 WHO
 WOULD
 BE.
 LET'S
 SEE WHAT
 THE
 FAT
 FARMER
 WAS
 HIDING." 

THE
 OTHERS
 MUTTERED
 SOME
 VAGUE
 AND
 NOT
 VERY
 CENSORIOUS
 LINES. 
THEY
 COULDN'T
 STAY
 HERE
 TOO
 LONG,
 AND
 SOME
 DECIDED
 TO TAKE
 A LITTLE
 NAP,
 AS GUS
 HAD
 OFFERED
 TO ESCORT
 THE
 GROUP
 TO BLUEBIRD
 AND
 OURSELVES,
 AND
 IN RETURN
 THEY
 COULD
 CLAIM
 SOMETHING
 FROM
 THE
 GREAT
 SPIRIT
 AND
 EVEN GET
 A POSSIBLE
 CUT OF WHAT
 THEY
 FOUND.
 THE
 ROCKERS
 HAD
 TAKEN
 THAT
 RISK
 - NOT
 BECAUSE
 THEY
 REALLY
 WANTED
 TO CHASE
 SOME
 IMMINENT
 CREATURES,
 BUT
 BECAUSE
 THE
 HINT
 FROM
 THE
 DURAITH
 HAD
 GIVEN
 THEM
 A CLEAR
 IDEA
 THAT
 IT WAS
 BETTER
 TO SUBMIT
 TO THESE
 FORCES. 
160 
 THE
 NEXT
 MORNING,
 VERY
 EARLY,
 THEY
 SET OUT
 FOR THE
 MENOMINEE
 RESERVATION,
 BUT
 DID
 NOT
 ENTER
 IT,
 BUT PRACTICALLY
 BYPASSED
 IT,
 ACCORDING
 TO THE
 INSTRUCTIONS
 OF GUS
 BENZOUR
 HIMSELF. 
GUS
 HAD
 ALSO
 EXPLAINED
 SOMETHING
 VERY
 ENTICING
 TO THEM
 - EVEN IF THEY
 FOUND
 ABSOLUTELY
 NOTHING
 IN THEIR
 SEARCH
 FOR FELISTER
'S INHERITANCE,
 THEY
 WERE
 GOING
 TO GET
 A FAT
 BRIBE
 FROM
 SOME
 OF THE
 POLITICIANS
 IN NOVA
 SCOTIA
 WHO
 WERE
 OF INDIAN
 DESCENT,
 IN THE
 FORM
 OF AN EXTORTION
 - AND
 THIS
 IDEA
 APPEALED
 TO THE
 BANDITS
 IMMENSELY,
 BECAUSE
 IT ALSO
 INVOLVED
 A CERTAIN
 AMOUNT
 OF SPECIFIC
 INFLUENCE,
 NOT
 JUST
 PLAIN
 ROBBERY. 
 
CHAPTER
 SIXTEEN:
 THE
 LAST
 LESSON 
 
ON THAT
 LAST
 NIGHT
 BEFORE
 THE
 ANGELS
 OF HELL
 CAME,
 BLUEBIRD
 GATHERED
 US TO IMPART
 HIS
 FINAL
 LESSON,
 FOR
 IN HIS
 WORDS
 IT WAS
 TOO
 LIKELY
 THAT
 HIS
 POWERS
 WOULD
 LEAVE
 HIM
 AT ANY
 MOMENT,
 AND
 THAT
 MEANT
 NEW
 TORMENT
 FOR
 ZONARA
 TO RESURRECT
 HIM
 AGAIN
 - AND
 HER
 POWERS
 WERE
 EXHAUSTED
 FROM
 THE
 PREVIOUS
 RITUAL. 
- "YOU
 WILL LEARN
 TO TRAVEL
 BY THE
 MOST
 ORDINARY
 ASTRAL
 PROJECTION,"
 BLUEBIRD
 DECLARED,
 "BUT YOU
 MUST
 REMEMBER
 THE
 VARIOUS
 PRINCIPLES
 OF THIS
 DIMENSION.
 YOU
 MAY
 EVEN COMMUNICATE
 WITH
 THE
 ARTIFICIAL
 DEMON
 THAT
 SUSTAINS
 MY SOUL
 HERE,
 BUT YOU
 MUST
 NOT
 LET
 THE
 NEGATIVE
 ENERGY
 THESE
 ETHEREAL
 CREATURES
 ENDOWED
 WITH
 CONSCIOUSNESS
 HAVE
 DESTROY
 YOU.
 OTHERWISE
 YOUR
 JOURNEY
 THERE
 WILL
 BE IN VAIN." 
SOME
 SPECIAL
 INSTRUCTIONS
 FOLLOWED,
 WHICH
 OPENED
 OUR
 EYES
 - ZONARA
 ADMITTED
 THAT
 MOST
 OF 161 
 THEM
 WERE
 KNOWN
 TO HER,
 BUT
 BLUEBIRD
 WAS
 A TRUE
 WIZARD
 WHO
 COULD
 EVEN
 WAGE
 AN ENTIRE
 WAR
 IN THE
 ASTRAL
 WORLD
 - AFTER
 ALL,
 HIS
 ANCESTORS
 WERE
 GREAT
 WARRIORS
 WHO
 HAD
 SHED
 THEIR
 BLOOD
 IN THE
 AMERICAN
 WAR
 OF INDEPENDENCE
 - SO HE HAD
 HIS
 FIGHTING
 SPIRIT
 TO DRAW
 FROM. 
- "AS I TOLD
 YOU,
 TIME
 PASSES
 DIFFERENTLY
 THERE,"
 BLUEBIRD
 CHIMED
 IN AGAIN,
 HIS
 PURSED
 LIPS
 BETRAYING
 THE
 PAIN
 HIS
 ALREADY
 CURSED
 SOUL
 FELT,
 "BUT
 DON'T
 FORGET
 THE
 MATERIAL
 WORLD.
 MATERIAL
 BODIES
 HAVE
 THEIR
 OWN
 ASTRAL
 PROJECTION
 FOLLOWING
 THEM,
 AND
 YOU
 MAY
 NOT
 BE ABLE
 TO MAKE
 YOUR
 JOURNEYS
 AGAIN
 - SO ACT
 WISELY.
 THIS
 MAY
 BE CRUCIAL
 ON THE
 PATH
 OF YOUR
 SALVATION.
 WE ARE,
 AFTER
 ALL,
 CHILDREN
 OF THE
 MIDDLE
 WORLD!
 AND
 THE
 YOUNGEST
 AND
 OLDEST
 ARE
 THE
 CLOSEST
 TO THE
 UNSEEN
 WORLDS!" 
HAVING
 SAID
 ALL THIS,
 BLUEBIRD
 POINTED
 OUT
 THAT
 WE MUST
 BE CONFIDENT
 ENOUGH
 THAT
 BEYOND
 WE MUST
 RELY
 SOLELY
 ON OURSELVES
 TO FIND
 A WAY
 OUT
 AND
 BACK
 INTO
 THIS
 WORLD. 
ARLO
 HAD
 SOBERED
 UP AND
 HADN'T
 TOUCHED
 HIS
 DUTCH
 GOODS
 IN A FEW
 DAYS
 - HE'D
 REALIZED
 THAT
 HIS
 LIFE
 HAD
 A CHANCE
 TO TURN
 IN A FAR
 BETTER
 DIRECTION,
 AND
 IF HE MADE
 THE
 EFFORT,
 MAYBE
 HE COULD
 FIND
 REDEMPTION
 FOR THE
 SINS
 HE'D
 COMMITTED
 - THE
 BETRAYALS,
 AND
 ALSO
 THE
 FUCKING
 LIFE
 OF AN UNDERCOVER
 INFORMANT
 HE'D
 BEEN
 LEADING. 

I HADN'T
 TOLD ZONARA
 ABOUT
 OUR
 CONVERSATION,
 BUT SHE
 WASN'T
 A CHILD
 AND
 I WAS
 SURE
 SHE
 SENSED
 THINGS
 NO WORSE
 THAN
 I DID.
 LIKE
 EVERY
 NECROMANCER
 AND
 BLACK
 MAGE,
 SHE
 HAD
 A FINE
 SENSITIVITY
 AND
 FEEL
 FOR THE
 EMOTIONS
 OF PEOPLE,
 AND
 ALSO
 FOR THE
 EMOTIONS
 OF SPIRITS
 - IN THE
 ASTRAL
 WORLD,
 THAT
 COULD
 ONLY
 BE OF USE
 TO HER
 162 
 - IN A WORLD
 WHERE
 UNSUSPECTED
 POSSIBILITIES
 LURKED. 

GUS
 RETURNED
 ONLY
 TO TELL
 THEM
 WHAT
 HAD
 HAPPENED
 BETWEEN
 HIM
 AND
 THE
 LEADER
 OF THE
 HELL
 ANGELS,
 DURAITH.
 THEY
 REMAINED
 SILENT,
 AND
 I, ELIZANDER
 BARNANE,
 SAT
 BY THE
 CAMPFIRE
 ON THE
 RESERVATION.
 WHO
 KNOWS
 WHY
 I FELT
 LIKE
 I WAS
 IN SOMEONE
 ELSE'S
 PLACE. 
THE
 CARVED
 FACES
 OF THE
 NATIVES
 LOOKED
 TO ME LIKE
 SOME
 MYSTICAL
 BAS-RELIEF,
 AND
 A SINGING
 SHADOW
 WAS
 BUSTLING
 ABOUT
 HELPING
 A BLUEBIRD,
 THOUGH
 THE
 DEMON
 THAT
 WAS
 MOST
 LIKELY
 AROUND
 WAS
 DISTURBING
 HER.
 SHE
 HAD
 MADE
 SOME
 SORT
 OF POTION
 OF HEALING
 HERBS
 TO INFUSE
 STRENGTH
 INTO
 HIS
 BATTERED
 BODY. 
- "AS ARRANGED,
 THEY'LL
 ARRIVE
 TOMORROW,"
 GUS
 SAID
 QUIETLY,
 "IT GETS
 REALLY
 SERIOUS
 FROM
 HERE." 
- "DO
 YOU
 REALLY
 BELIEVE
 THEM
?," INTERJECTED
 ARLO,
 "THEY
 ARE
 LIVING
 BARBARIANS.
 DEMONS
 IN HUMAN
 SKINS!
 THEY
 COULD
 KILL
 EVERYONE!" 
ZONARA
 WAS
 SILENT,
 QUIETLY
 SAYING
 SOME
 PROTECTIVE
 SPELL
 IN HER
 MIND.
 IN THE
 WORLD
 OF TRUE
 MAGIC,
 THE
 MESSAGE
 HAD
 TO BE SINCERE,
 SMOOTH,
 AND
 EVEN-TONED
 - THAT
 MADE
 IT EXTREMELY
 POWERFUL,
 AND
 IT USUALLY
 WORKED. 
- "THEY
 WILL
 FOLLOW
 THE
 PATH
 MAPPED
 OUT
 FOR THEM
 BY GUS,"
 A BLUE
 BIRD
 APPROACHED,
 "THEY
 WILL
 BE LIKE
 LITTLE
 CHILDREN
 IN YOUR
 ARMS.
 PUPPETS
 WHO
 FOLLOW
 ORDERS
 - AND
 NOTHING
 MORE,
 BUT
 AT THE
 SAME
 TIME
 WILL
 HAVE
 THEIR
 OWN
 CONSCIOUSNESS
 AND
 UNDERSTAND
 THE
 BENEFIT
 OF THEIR
 INPUT
 IN FINDING
 YOUR
 ANSWERS." 
BLUEBIRD
 WAS
 KIND
 OF SCARY,
 BUT ANYONE
 WHO
 KNEW
 HIM
 COULD
 JUST
 SEE THAT
 THE
 OLD
 DEMON
 WAS
 163 
 WEARING
 HIM
 DOWN
 QUITE
 A BIT,
 AND
 WE APPRECIATED
 THE
 FACT
 THAT
 EVEN
 THOUGH
 HE WAS
 HALF
 ALI
VE AND
 USING
 HIS
 LAST
 STRENGTH,
 HE WAS
 DOING
 HIS
 BEST
 TO HELP
 US. 
- "YOU
 MUST
 MAKE
 YOUR
 FIRST
 ASTRAL
 JOURNEY
 BEFORE
 THEY
 COME,"
 SAID
 BLUEBIRD. 
ZONARA
 DECIDED
 TO BE FIRST,
 BUT
 ARLO
 EXPRESSED
 HIS
 DESIRE
 FOR HIM
 TO IMMERSE
 HIMSELF
 IN THIS
 STRANGE
 WORLD
 AND
 GET A TASTE
 OF IT. 
WE ALL
 RETURNED
 TO THE
 TEPEE,
 AND
 ARLO
 LAY
 DOWN
 ON THE
 SOFT
 INDIAN
 BLANKET
 - BOTH
 ZONARA
 AND
 BLUEBIRD
 WERE
 READY
 TO PROVIDE
 TIMELY
 ASSISTANCE
 IN CASE
 OF NEED. 
- "PLACE
 AND
 TIMING
 ARE
 VERY
 IMPORTANT
 WHEN
 SENDING
 YOUR
 ASTRAL
 SUBSTANCE,"
 BLUEBIRD
 GAVE
 FINAL
 INSTRUCTIONS
 BEFORE
 ARLO
 DOVE
 BEYOND
 FOR THE
 FIRST
 TIME. 
ARLO
 EJECTED
 HIS
 ASTRAL
 SUBSTANCE
 THROUGH
 THE
 SOLAR
 PLEXUS,
 AND
 FOLLOWING
 THE
 CLOUD
 OF ASTRAL
 SUBSTANCE
 THAT
 FORMED,
 HE SLOWLY
 FORMED
 A SPHERE
 OF ASTRAL
 MATTER
 THAT
 WAS
 BOUND
 TO THE
 POINT
 OF EJECTION
 WITH
 AN ASTRAL
 THREAD. 

AFTER
 A WHILE,
 ARLO
 HAD
 REACHED
 A STATE
 OF VIBRATION. 

HIS
 ASTRAL
 BODY
 SEPARATED
 FROM
 HIS
 PHYSICAL
 BODY,
 AND
 HE FLEW
 IN HIS
 IMAGINATION
 TO WHERE
 THE
 INDIAN
 CEMETERY
 WAS. 
IT ALL
 SEEMED A LITTLE
 STRANGE
 TO HIM
 - HE COULD
 NATURALLY
 OBSERVE
 HIS
 PHYSICAL
 BODY,
 BUT
 AS HE WAS
 IN THE
 AIR
 HE COULD
 FEEL
 SOME
 DIFFERENCES.
 ARLO
 FELT
 THAT
 HIS
 HEARING
 HADN'T
 CARRIED
 OVER
 TO THE
 HIGHER
 LEVELS
 OF CONSCIOUSNESS,
 INSTEAD
 164 
 HE WAS
 PICKING
 UP SOME
 FRAGMENTED
 STATIC
 EERIE
 NOISES
 THAT
 WOULD
 STARTLE
 ANYONE
 ELSE,
 BUT HE REMEMBERED
 BLUEBIRD'S
 MOST
 IMPORTANT
 PIECE
 OF ADVICE
 - BE THE
 MASTER
 OF YOUR
 FEAR
 SO THAT
 YOU
 CAN
 RETURN
 TO YOUR
 PHYSICAL
 BODY
 WITHOUT
 A PROBLEM. 

ARLO
 HAD MEMORIZED
 CERTAIN
 POINTS
 ON HIS
 ROUTE,
 BUT HE WANTED
 TO SEE
 HOW
 MUCH
 CONTROL
 HE COULD
 EXERT
 OVER
 THE
 NEW
 REALITY
 - IF HE COULD
 REALLY
 CHANGE
 NIGHT
 TO DAY,
 OR IF HE COULD
 CHANGE
 SOMETHING
 ELSE. 
THEN
 HE GLIMPSED
 THE
 ETHEREAL
 ARTIFICIAL
 DEMON
 - IT LOOKED
 LIKE
 A CROSS
 BETWEEN
 FLAME
 OR SMOKE
 WITH
 SUBTLE
 OUTLINES
 OF THIN
 MATTER.
 IT SEEMED
 TO BE QUITE
 CLOSE
 TO ITS
 HOST
 - NO MORE
 THAN
 HALF
 A METER
 TO A METER
 AND
 A HALF
 AWAY,
 AND
 OBVIOUSLY
 CONNECTED
 TO ITS
 SOLAR
 PLEXUS. 
ARLO
 REALIZED
 THAT
 THIS
 WAS
 ALL
 DAMN
 REAL,
 AND
 NOT
 JUST
 SOME
 MOVIE
 HE WAS
 WATCHING
 FROM
 THE
 SIDE. 

THE
 DEMON
 SWAYED
 LANGUIDLY,
 AND
 THE
 BLUEBIRD'S
 SOUL
 WAS
 LIKE
 A HOLE
 IN THE
 GROUND. 
- "SO HE COMMITTED
 SUICIDE,"
 ARLO
 WONDERED,
 "THERE
 ARE
 WHOLE
 CHUNKS OF HIS
 SPIRIT
 MISSING
 THAT
 EVEN AN ARTIFICIALLY
 CREATED
 DEMON
 CAN'T
 PATCH
 UP. 
HE HADN'T
 SMOKED
 WEED
 IN A FEW
 DAYS
 AND HIS
 MIND
 WAS
 CLEAR
 ENOUGH,
 AS IT TOOK
 AT LEAST
 A WEEK
 AND
 SOMETIMES
 LONGER
 FOR
 THE
 EFFECTS
 OF THE
 HIGH
 TO WEAR
 OFF COMPLETELY
 - SOMETIMES
 IT TOOK
 A MONTH
 OR MORE. 
ARLO
 HAD
 THE
 STRANGE
 FEELING
 THAT
 SOMEONE
 WAS
 WATCHING
 HIM
 AND
 WANTED
 TO TELL
 HIM
 SOMETHING,
 165 
 BUT SOME
 INVISIBLE
 BARRIER
 WAS
 STOPPING
 THE
 COMMUNICATION. 

- "IT'S
 NOT
 FEAR,"
 THE
 YOUNG
 MAN
 CONCLUDED,
 "AFTER
 ALL,
 I WAS
 LIKE
 A STIFF,
 AND
 NOW
 I'M
 THE
 MASTER
 OF THE
 SITUATION.
 I SEE
 AND
 FEEL
 FREELY." 
ARLO
 KNEW
 THAT
 USUALLY
 THE
 EFFECT
 OF SMOKING
 QUALITY
 CANNABIS
 LED
 TO HEADACHES
 IN ADDITION
 TO PLEASANT
 EXPERIENCES,
 BUT
 HERE
 LAY
 A SERIOUS
 PROBLEM
 TIED
 TO THEIR
 MENTOR. 
- "BLUEBIRD
 WAS
 NOT
 COMMUNICATING
 WITH
 HIS
 HIGHER
 SELF.
 BUT
 WHY?
 COULD
 THE
 DEMON
 BE THE
 REASON
?," REASONED
 ARLO.
 BLUEBIRD
 NEVER
 HAD
 THE
 DIVINE
 SPAR
K. NO THAT'S
 IMPOSSIBLE! 
ARLO
 WAS
 CONFUSED.
 HE DIDN'T
 KNOW
 HOW
 TO REACT,
 BUT
 NOTHING
 SEEMED
 TO HAPPEN
 IN THE
 ASTRAL
 WORLD
 WITHOUT
 SOME
 REACTION
 FROM
 HIM. 
ARLO
 FELT
 THAT
 THE
 BOUNDARIES
 OF THIS
 WORLD
 WERE
 IMMEASURABLY
 GREATER
 THAN
 THOSE
 OF THE
 PHYSICAL
 WORLD,
 AND
 HE BEGAN
 TO SENSE
 SOME
 UNCLEAN
 ENTITIES
 TRYING
 TO GET
 AT HIS
 OWN
 BODY.
 BUT HE WOULD
 RESIST. 
EVEN THE
 ARTIFICIAL
 DEMON
 SHOWED
 AN APPETITE,
 BUT ARLO
 UTTERED
 THE
 BLESSING
 HE HAD
 USED
 AS AN ENERGY
 SHIELD
 TO PROTECT
 HIS
 BODY
 FROM
 ENCROACHMENT
 ONCE
 MORE AND
 HE RETREATED.
 THOUGH
 IT SEEMED ALMOST
 COMICAL
 - THE
 DANGER
 WAS
 VERY
 REAL. 
- "DO
 I REALLY
 POSSESS
 THE
 QUALITIES
 OF AN ASTRAL
 SEEKER
?," WONDERED
 THE
 HIPSTER,
 WHO
 WASN'T
 THE
 MOST
 RELIGIOUS
 OF TYPES,
 BUT
 WAS
 IMMERSED
 IN THIS
 WORLD
 IN A WAY
 THAT
 FILLED
 HIM WITH
 INCREASING
 CONFIDENCE. 
166 
 HE TURNED
 TO THE
 BLUEBIRD
 - HIS
 FACE
 WAS
 A BLUR
 OF HOLES
 AND
 HIS
 ASTRAL
 BODY
 LOOKED
 LIKE
 SWISS
 CHEESE. 

- "APPARENTLY
 THE
 EFFECTS
 ON HIS
 SPIRIT
 ARE
 IRREPARABLE,"
 ARLO
 SADLY
 CONCLUDED,
 AND
 EMBARKED
 ON HIS
 JOURNEY. 
HE HAD
 TO IDENTIFY
 THE
 EXACT
 LOCATION
 OF THE
 LA POINTE
 CEMETERY
 AND
 IN PARTICULAR
 THAT
 PLACE
 WHERE
 THE
 RITUAL
 WAS
 TO BE PERFORMED. 
THE
 POINT
 OF THIS
 JOURNEY
 WAS
 THAT
 HE COULD
 SPOT
 SOMETHING
 HE WOULD
 NOT
 SEE IN THE
 MATERIAL
 WORLD.
 ARLO
 HAD NOT
 FORGOTTEN
 THAT
 THE
 SINGING
 SHADOW
 HAD
 NOT
 SHARED
 EVERYTHING
 WITH
 THEM,
 AND
 IN ADDITION
 TO REFUSING
 TO SPEAK,
 SHE
 HAD
 DECLARED
 HER
 POWERLESSNESS
 TO HELP
 THEM
 - APPARENTLY
 THIS
 INVISIBLE
 BARRIER
 WAS
 STOPPING
 HER
 EFFORTS. 
THE
 PHYSICAL
 DISTANCE
 BETWEEN
 THE
 PRESERVE
 AND
 THE
 CEMETERY
 WAS
 ON THE
 ORDER
 OF A HUNDRED
 AND
 FIFTY
 MILES,
 BUT
 ARLO
 FLEW
 OVER
 IT MUCH
 FASTER
 AND
 REACHED
 MADELINE
 ISLAND,
 WHERE
 IT WAS
 LOCATED. 

BUT SUDDENLY
 HE FELT
 THE
 INVISIBLE
 SPIRIT
 FOLLOWING
 HIM
 - AS IF IT WANTED
 TO GRAB
 HIM
 - NO IT WASN'T
 THE
 BLUEBIRD
 SOUL
 DEMON
 - IT WAS
 SOMETHING
 MUCH
 MORE
 DANGEROUS. 
AS HE GOT
 CLOSER
 TO THE
 GRAVEYARD,
 HE FELT
 ITS
 PRESENCE
 EVEN MORE
 CLEARLY
 - IT WASN'T
 AS OMINOUS
 BECAUSE
 IT MIXED
 WITH
 THE
 OTHER
 AURAS
 OF DEAD
 SOULS,
 DEAD
 ANIMALS
 AND
 WHATNOT. 
ARLO
 GUESSED
 THAT
 MADLYN
 ISLAND
 HAD
 LONG
 BEEN THE
 SPIRITUAL
 CENTER
 OF THIS
 AREA
 - HE COULD
 FEEL
 THE
 ENERGY
 OF THE
 PLACE
 ALL
 TOO
 PALPABLY. 
167 
 HE DECIDED
 TO WALK
 OVER
 TO THE
 CEMETERY
 ITSELF
 AND
 TAKE
 A LOOK - MAYBE
 HE'D
 FIND
 SOMETHING
 ELSE
 THAT
 WOULD
 HELP. 
HE SAW
 THE
 BREAKWATER
 THAT
 PROTECTED
 THE
 CEMETE
RY FROM
 THE
 WAVES
 OF LAKE
 SUPERIOR.
 GLIMPSED
 THE
 SYMBOLS
 OF CHRISTIANS,
 THE
 GRAVES
 OF OJIBWE
20, AND
 ALSO
 THAT
 MANY
 OF THE
 MONUMENTS
 HAD
 KEELED
 OVER,
 SUBJECT
 TO TIME. 
"REMEMBER
 THAT
 TIME
 IN THE
 ASTRAL
 WORLD
 IS NOT
 LINEAR!"
 WAS
 ONE
 OF BLUEBIRD'S
 MOST
 IMPORTANT
 RECOMMENDATIONS. 

IN INDIAN
 FOLKLORE
 FUNERALS
 OCCUPIED
 AN IMPORTANT
 PLACE,
 AND
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND
 ARLO
 HAD
 LISTENED
 TOO ATTENTIVELY
 TO THE
 EXPLANATIONS
 THAT
 THE
 ASTRAL
 AND
 SPIRITUAL
 WORLDS
 WERE
 SOMETHING
 DIFFERENT
 AND
 OUR
 UNDERSTANDING
 OF THEM
 WAS
 NOT
 TO BE
 CONFUSED. 
ARLO
 DECIDED
 TO GO DOWN
 AND
 EXAMINE
 THE
 GRAVES
 MORE
 CAREFULLY.
 HE SAW
 QUITE
 CLEARLY
 THE
 SPIRIT
 HOUSES
 THAT
 HAD
 BEEN
 BUILT,
 WHICH
 WERE
 AT A SUFFICIENT
 DISTANCE
 FROM
 THE
 OTHER
 GRAVES
 SO THAT
 THE
 DEAD
 COULD
 ENJOY
 THEIR
 AFTERLIFE. 
- "HOW
 STRANGE!"
 EXCLAIMED
 ARLO,
 "AS
 IF HE HAD
 LOST
 TRACK
 OF TIME.
 - APPARENTLY
 THERE
 ARE
 NO BARRIERS
 IN THE
 SPIRIT
 WORLD,
 BUT
 HERE
 I CAN
 STILL
 FEEL
 SOMEONE'S
 PRESENCE. 
HE TURNED
 AND
 SAW
 THE
 GHOST
 OF DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 - OR RATHER,
 HIS
 ASTRAL
 PROJECTION. 
THE
 DETECTIVE
 LOOKED
 DAZED
 AND
 OUT
 OF PLACE
 - AS IF HE DIDN'T
 LIKE
 THIS
 WORLD,
 BUT
 HAD
 ENDED
 UP IN IT IN A NOT
 VERY
 PRETTY
 WAY. 
                                               
 20   The Ojibwe is one of the Indian tribes of North Ameri
ca. 
168 
 - "HE COMMITTED
 SUICIDE,"
 ARLO
 CONCLUDED.
 "I
 SHOULD
 ASK
 HIM
 WHAT
 HE'S
 LOOKING
 FOR
 IN THAT
 SAME
 GRAVEYARD." 
DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN'S
 GHOST
 DIDN'T
 ANSWER,
 HE JUST
 WALKED
 BETWEEN
 THE
 GRAVES.
 LA POINTE'S
 TERRITORY
 WAS
 VAST-
AT LEAST
 AN ACRE
 AND
 A HALF.
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 DIDN'T
 SEEM PARTICULARLY
 ORIENTED
 IN HIS
 MOVEMENT
 IN THE
 ASTRAL. 
ACCORDING
 TO SOME
 UNDERSTANDINGS,
 THE
 SOULS
 OF THE
 SUICIDED
 INHABITED
 PRECISELY
 THE
 SECOND
 ASTRAL
 PLANE,
 WHERE
 THEY
 COULD
 VISIT
 THE
 LIVING
 IN THEIR
 DREAMS. 
DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 LOOKED
 COMPLETELY
 DIGNIFIED
 - JUST
 AS HE DID
 AT THE
 MOMENT
 OF HIS
 UNWISELY
 INDUCED
 DEATH,
 BUT
 HIS
 FACE
 WAS
 AS IF IT HAD
 BEEN
 BRIGHTENED
 - LIKE
 THAT
 OF A BLUEBIRD. 
- "PERHAPS
 THERE
 WAS
 DEMONIC
 INTERFERENCE
 AGAIN,"
 ARLO
 WHISPERED,
 BUT
 DECIDED
 TO FOLLOW
 HIS
 SPIRIT
 AT A DISTANCE,
 "HE
 WILL PROBABLY
 NEVER
 TRULY
 ENTER
 THE
 SPIRIT
 WORLD,
 WHICH
 IS DESTINED
 FOR THOSE
 WHO
 TRULY
 WANTED
 TO LIVE." 
DONOVAN
 WAS
 IN HIS
 TRE
NCH COAT
 - TIGHT
 IN THE
 MOST
 PROFESSIONAL
 WAY
 AND
 READY
 TO DEAL
 WITH
 CRIMINALS,
 OR PERHAPS
 IN HIS
 MIND
 THAT
 IMAGE
 WAS
 THE
 CLOSEST
 TO HIS
 IDEAL
 OF THE
 PERFECT
 COP. 
ARLO
 CONTINUED
 TO FOLLOW
 WITHOUT
 UNDERSTANDING
 EXACTLY
 WHAT
 WAS
 GOING
 ON AND
 SUDDENLY
 FELT
 THE SAME
 BARRIER
 PREVENTING
 HIM
 FROM
 GOING
 ANY
 FURTHER. 
DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 TURNED
 AND
 SEEMED TO MOTION
 FOR HIM
 TO FOLLOW,
 BUT
 ARLO
 SAW
 THAT
 HE WAS
 LOOKING
 IMPASSIVELY
 AS IF INTO
 NOTHINGNESS.
 THEN
 TURNED
 AND
 CONTINUED
 ON HIS
 WAY,
 AND
 ARLO
 SEEMED TO HAVE
 TO FOL
LOW HIM. 
169 
 BUT SOMEONE
 SEEMED
 TO TOUCH
 HIM
 ON THE
 SHOULDER
 - NEXT
 TO HIM
 WERE
 ZONARA
 AND
 ELIZANDER.
 BOTH
 READY
 TO BACK
 HIM
 UP - THEY
 HAD
 BEEN
 FOLLOWING
 ROUGHLY
 THE
 SAME
 ROUTE
 FOR SOME
 TIME,
 AS THEY
 MEMORIZED
 THE
 NECESSARY
 ASTRAL
 POINTS
 NEEDED
 FOR
 THEIR
 JOURN
EY. AND
 SUDDENLY
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 STOPPED
 IN FRONT
 OF A LONELY
 GRAVE
 THAT
 READ
 JACK. 
"WAIT
 A MINUTE!"
 RAN
 THROUGH
 MY MIND
 FOR A SECOND.
 - "THE
 COINCIDENCE
 OF THE
 NAMES
 IS HARDLY
 COINCIDENTAL." 
THEN
 SOME
 INEXPLICABLE
 FORCE
 SEEMED
 TO KNOCK
 OUT
 THE
 ASTRAL
 PROJECTIONS
 OF ZONAR
 AND
 ARLO
 AND
 I WAS
 LEFT
 ALONE. 
"I CONTACTED
 JAKE,"
 JAKE
 DONOVAN
 ADDRESSED
 ME, "HE
 COMMITTED
 WHAT
 IS CALLED
 AN ASSISTED
 SUICIDE
 SO THAT
 ZONARA
 COULD
 COVER
 HIS
 TRACKS.
 SHE'S
 THE
 REAL
 CAUSE
 OF DEATH,
 DIDN'T
 YOU
 FIGURE
 IT OUT? 
THE
 DEMON
 THAT
 DESTROYED
 ME IS THE
 DEMON
 OF HER
 OWN
 SOUL!" 
- "YOU
 MEAN
 SHE
 WAS
 NEVER
 ALIVE,"
 I STAMMERED. 
- SHE
 ONLY
 EXISTED
 BECAUSE
 OF THE
 CARTELS,
 WHOSE
 MEMBERS,
 ALONG
 WITH
 FELISTER,
 PRAYED
 TO HER,
 AND
 IN THE
 RITUAL
 FOR THE
 GUARDIAN
 ANGEL,
 SOMETHING
 WENT
 WRONG
 AND
 A NEGATIVE
 ESSENCE
 TOOK
 POSSESSION
 OF HER.
 HAVE
 YOU
 NOT
 NOTICED
 THAT
 MY SON
 JAKE,
 WHO
 IS ILLEGITIMATE,
 AND
 I HAVE
 NEVER
 SEEN HIM,
 AND
 NEVER
 EVEN SUSPECTED
 HIS
 EXISTENCE,"
 THE
 SPIRIT
 OF DONOVAN
 CONTINUED,
 "HAS
 EXPRESSED
 A GREAT
 DESIRE
 TO HELP
 YOU?
 WHAT
 YUPPIE
 WOULD
 DO IT UNSELFISHLY!
 EVEN
 I THE
 GUARDIAN
 OF THE
 LAW
 LEVELLED
 THE
 INFERNAL
 HOUSE
 OF A FELISTER,
 BUT
 I GOT SOMETHING!
 MY REASON
 FOR HELPING
 YOU
 IS THAT
 I WANT
 170 
 RETRIBUTION,
 AND
 I CAN'T
 HOPE
 FOR MUCH
 FROM
 MY PRESENT
 POSITION!
 THE
 ONLY
 REASON
 YOU'RE
 STILL
 ALIVE
 IS BECAUSE
 ZONARA
 FEELS
 SOME
 DISCOMFORT
 IN YOUR
 PRESENCE
 THAT
 THREATENS
 HER.
 THE
 DEMON
 THAT
 HAS
 TAKEN
 UP RESIDENCE
 WITHIN
 HER
 IS VERY
 CUNNING,
 BUT
 NOT
 STRONG
 ENOUGH
 TO DEAL
 WITH
 YOU.
 JAKE
 AND
 I, HIS
 FATHER
 JAKE
 DONOVAN,
 FELL
 FOR
 A CAUSE
 THAT
 WAS
 NOT
 WORTH
 PURSUING,
 BUT
 OUR
 INTERESTS
 ARE
 PRACTICALLY
 COMMON,"
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 FINISHED. 
- "ANSWER
 ME JUST
 WHO
 ORDERED
 THE
 ATTACK
 ON THE
 FELISTER
?," MORE
 FORMIDABLE
 EVEN THAN
 THE
 FELISTER
 HIMSELF,"
 I ASKED
 HIM. 
- THAT
 YOU
 WILL
 HAVE
 TO DISCOVER
 FOR YOURSELF.
 BUT KNOW
 THIS
 - THE
 ANSWER
 WILL
 SURPRISE
 YOU
 TERRIBLY
 - YOU
 HAVE
 A TRAITOR
 ON YOUR
 TEAM
 IN THE
 PERSON
 OF ARLO
 AND
 A DEMON-INTRIGUER
 IN THE
 PERSON
 OF THE
 FATAL
 ZONARA.
 THREE
 ENTITIES
 FIGHTING
 FOR
 SURVIVAL. 
I READ
 THE
 TOMBSTONE
 CAREFULLY
 - DONOVAN
 WASN'T
 LYING.
 AND
 WHY WOULD
 HE,
 GIVEN
 THAT
 HE WOULD
 NEVER
 REACH
 THE
 SPIRIT
 WORLD! 
- "MY FATE
 IS TOO
 HARD
 - I AM DOOMED
 TO BE HERE
 FOR A THOUSAND
 YEARS,
 AND
 THEN
 MY SOUL
 MAY
 DISAPPEAR,"
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 FINISHED.
 "DON'T
 LET
 YOUR
 COMPANIONS
 REACH
 THE
 GUARDIAN
 ANGEL
 BEFORE
 YOU
 - OTHERWISE
 MY HELP
 FOR
 YOU
 HAS
 BEEN
 USELESS."
 WHEN
 WE RETURNED
 TO OUR
 MATERIAL
 BODIES,
 I WAS
 ACUTELY
 AWARE
 THAT
 THE
 PHYSICAL
 TIME
 I HAD
 SPENT
 WITH
 DONOVAN
 HAD
 APPARENTLY
 BEEN
 LESS
 THAN
 A SECOND
 - THIS
 SURREPTITIOUS
 MOVE
 MAY
 HAVE
 HELPED
 SOMEWHAT
 TO JUSTIFY
 MY LATER
 RETURN
 TO THE
 OTHERS. 
171 
 BLUEBIRD
 WATCHED
 OUR
 FACES
 CAREFULLY,
 BUT MY LATER
 RETURN
 DIDN'T
 SEEM
 TO MAKE
 MUCH
 OF AN IMPRESSION
 ON HIM
 - PERHAPS
 THE
 ARTIFICIAL
 DEMON
 WAS
 DISTRACTING
 HIM,
 AND
 THAT
 FACT
 ONLY
 WORKED
 IN MY FAVOR. 
I LOOKED
 AROUND
 - ZONARA
 AND
 ARLO
 WERE
 ALSO
 RECOVERING
 FROM
 THEIR
 EXPERIENCE. 
WELL,
 I HADN'T
 LEARNED
 MUCH
 OF ANYTHING,
 BUT
 I FELT
 THAT
 BEHIND
 THE
 SEEMING
 LACK
 OF INFORMATION
 WAS
 THE
 KEY
 TO MY SURVIVAL. 
BLUEBIRD
 COUGHED
 FROM
 THE
 TOBACCO
 HE WAS
 SMOKING
 AND
 EXPLAINED
 TO US THAT
 THE
 ROCKE
RS RECRUITED
 BY GUS
 WOULD
 MOST
 LIKELY
 BE ALONG
 SHORTLY. 

IT WAS
 BETWEEN
 THREE
 AND
 FOUR
 IN THE
 MORNING
 - AND
 IN MY EXPERIENCE,
 THAT'S
 WHEN
 THE
 SPIRITS
 ATTACKED,
 USUALLY
 EXPLOITING
 THE
 VULNERABILITY
 OF THE
 SLEEPING,
 TRYING
 TO DRINK
 THEIR
 LIFE
 ENERGY
 - THIS
 APPLIED
 TO DEAD
 SOULS
 OF HUMANS,
 BY THE
 WAY. 

- "WELL,
 YOU
 ARE
 READY
 FOR YOUR
 JOURNEY
 NOW,"
 THE
 BLUEBIRD
 CONCLUDED
 SOMEWHAT
 SADLY,
 "OUR
 PATHS
 ARE
 PARTING
 AND
 WE MAY
 NEVER
 SEE EACH
 OTHER
 AGAIN.
 BUT,
 IF IT'S
 NOT
 A PROBLEM,
 PRAY
 TO THE
 GREAT
 SPIRIT
 FOR
 ME TOO!" 
HIS
 WORDS
 SURPRISED
 US A LITTLE,
 BUT
 BLUEBIRD
 HAD
 DONE
 A LOT
 FOR
 US AND
 DESERVED
 TO BE HONORED
 WITH
 DIGNITY. 
BLUEBIRD
 THEN
 SANG: 
"WE WILL
 WATCH
 THE
 SHADOWS
 OF TWILIGHT, 
BY THE
 MOON'S
 ENDLESS
 COURSE, 
YA,
 HEH,
 YO,
 HEH,
 YO, 
172 
 NOW
 I'LL
 GO TO MY HUT, 
AND
 WE'LL
 WATCH
 THE
 RISING
 SUN. 
WELL,
 WELL,
 WELL,
 WELL,
 WELL,
 WELL
21." 
WE DECIDED
 WE HAD
 NO MORE
 TIME
 TO WASTE
 - BLUEBIRD
 HAD
 TAUGHT
 US THE
 MOST
 IMPORTANT
 THING
 WE NEEDED
 TO KNOW.
 BEFORE
 WE LEFT,
 THOUGH,
 HE SURREPTITIOUSLY
 GAVE
 ME A LITTLE
 AMULET
 WITH
 THE
 WORDS: 
- WHAT YOU
 SEE WILL
 LEAD
 YOU
 TO THE
 PATH
 OF TRUTH.
 BE IN NO DOUBT
 THAT
 YOU
 MUST
 BEWARE
 OF THE
 REST.
 SOON
 YOU
 WILL
 SEE
 THROUGH
 AND
 ... AT THAT
 MOMENT
 A BLUE
 BIRD
 CRASHED
 TO THE
 GROUND
 - HE WAS
 DEAD
 - AT EXACTLY
 THREE
 O'CLOCK
 AND
 FIFTEEN
 MINUTES
 IN THE
 MORNING. 
IT'S
 SAD
 THAT
 SOMETIMES
 YOU
 MET
 GOOD
 PEOPLE
 IN YOUR
 LIFE
 THAT
 FATE
 TAKES
 AWAY
 FROM
 YOU.
 AND
 THOSE
 SAME
 PEOPLE
 WERE
 HIDING
 SCARS
 IN THEIR
 SOULS.
 AND
 THE
 WHOLE
 POINT
 OF THEIR
 LIVES
 WAS
 TO MAKE
 OTHERS
 HAPPY,
 AND
 WAS
 THAT
 HAPPINESS
 NOT
 DECEPTIVE?
 AND
 HOW
 LONG
 DID
 ONE
 HAVE
 TO SEARCH
 FOR IT BEFORE
 FINALLY
 REALIZING
 THAT
 IT WAS
 AN EXTREMELY
 SUBJECTIVE
 PERCEPTION! 
HIS
 GESTURES
 SEEMED TO GO UNNOTICED
 BY ARLO
 AND
 THE
 ZONAR
 - AS IF AN INVISIBLE
 CAPE
 HAD
 DESCENDED
 AND
 SEPARATED
 US BY AN UNIMAGINABLY
 GREAT
 DISTANCE. 
HAVING
 PREPARED
 OUR
 LUGGAGE,
 WE LEFT
 THE
 INDIAN
 TEPEE
 AWAITING
 OUR
 ESCORT. 
                                                
 21 The song was recorded in 1941 by teacher Leah K. Hicks.

173 
 CHAPTER
 SEVENTEEN:
 THE
 MORTAL
 ENEMY 
 
FATHER
 TOBIAS
 HAD
 RETIRED
 TO THE
 ABBEY,
 WHERE
 HE USUALLY
 MINISTERED
 AND
 ATTENDED
 TO THE
 ADMINISTRATIVE
 PART
 OF THE
 GOVERNMENT
 OF HIS
 CONGREGATION.
 THIS
 ABBEY
 WAS
 IN THE
 NORTHWESTERN
 PART
 OF THE
 STATE
 OF MISSOURI.
 THE
 BEAUTIFUL
 ARCHITECTURE
 OF THE
 BUILDING
 WAS
 IMPRESSIVE
 AND
 PROVOKED
 REFLECTION
 AND
 PRAYER
 AND
 SERVED
 TO PRAISE
 THE
 CREATOR.
 THE
 MOTTO
 WAS
 "ORA
 ET LABORA
 ET LEGE
22". BUT HE HAD
 HEARD
 OF DONOVAN'S
 DEMISE
 AND
 HAD SEEN IT ALL
 - SO HE DEFINITELY
 HAD
 INFORMATION
 ON THE
 CASE. 
HE WAS
 ALSO
 AWARE
 THAT
 THE
 STORY
 WAS
 UNLIKELY
 TO STOP
 THERE.
 HE HAD
 A THOROUGH
 KNOWLEDGE
 OF EXORCISM
 AND
 DEMONOLOGY
 AND
 FELT
 A REAL
 DESIRE
 TO UNRAVEL
 THE
 CASE
 - NOT
 JUST
 FOR
 RELIGIOUS
 REASONS,
 BUT
 BECAUSE
 HE BELIEVED
 HE COULD
 SAVE
 MANY
 LIVES
 THROUGH
 HIS
 INTERVENTION. 
BUT HE HAD
 BEEN
 ORDERED
 FROM
 THE
 HIGHEST
 PLACE
 TO STAY
 AWAY.
 YES, ONE
 HAD
 NO INTEREST
 IN CERTAIN
 DETAILS
 COMING
 TO LIGHT
 AND
 MOREOVER
 BEING
 ... 
HE DREW
 HIMSELF
 UP IN A SPLENDID
 ARMCHAIR
 - AS ORNATE
 AS IT WAS
 A FAMILY
 HEIRLOOM. 
THE
 PRIEST
 WAS
 AWARE
 THAT
 THE
 INVASION
 OF THE
 FELISTER
 FARM
 BY DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 WAS
 PROBABLY
 PATRONIZED
 AT THE
 HIGHEST
 LEVEL,
 BUT IT WAS
 UNCLEAR
 WHAT
 THE
 CONNECTION
 WAS
 BETWEEN
 THE
 DEMONS
 IN HIS
 HOME
 AND
 THE
 WHOLE
 STORY
 OF THE
 STRANGE
 GRIMOIRES. 
                                               
 22  From the Latin it means "Prayer, labour and study". 
174 
 SOMEWHERE
 IN THERE,
 FATHER
 TOBIAS
 REALIZED
 THAT
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 HAD
 MADE
 A WILLING
 SACRIFICE
 THAT
 WOULD
 GIVE
 HIM
 THE
 RIGHT
 TO GUIDE
 OTHERS
 WILLING
 TO FOLLOW
 THE
 PATH
 OF TRUTH. 
MORALLY
 SPEAKING,
 DONOVAN
 HAD
 FOREVER
 LOST
 HIS
 RIGHT
 TO PASS
 INTO
 THE
 SPIRIT
 WORLD,
 AND
 WOULD
 BE WANDERING
 THE
 LOWER
 LEVELS
 OF THE
 ASTRAL,
 TRYING
 TO MAKE
 SENSE
 OF THE
 STRANGE
 SERIES
 OF EVENTS
 THAT
 HAD
 LED
 HIM
 HERE. 
BUT TOBIAS
 HAD
 ALSO
 TOLD
 HIM
 THAT
 THERE
 WERE
 NO COINCIDENCES,
 AND
 THAT
 BEFORE
 ENTERING
 THIS
 REALM
 THE
 SOUL
 HAD
 AGREED
 TO A CERTAIN
 BARGAIN
 WITH
 THE
 CREATOR
 THAT
 IT WAS
 OBLIGATED
 TO FULFILL
 IN ORDER
 TO FURTHER
 ITS
 SPIRITUAL
 EXISTENCE
 AND
 GROWTH. 
DONOVAN
 HAD
 ACCEPTED
 WHAT
 HE HAD
 BEEN
 TOLD
 WITH
 PROFESSIONAL
 RESPECT,
 BUT HE WAS
 NOT
 A TRUE
 BELIEVER
 - HE HAD
 ENLISTED
 THE
 SERVICES
 OF THE
 PRIEST
 TO REVEAL
 SOME
 OF THE
 FINER
 DETAILS
 OF THE
 LIFE
 OF A FELISTER
 AND
 WHAT
 EXACTLY
 HE WAS
 UP AGAINST,
 BUT
 HE HAD
 NOT
 SHOWN
 THE
 ATTENTION
 HE SHOULD
 HAVE. 
THE
 PRIEST
 MENTALLY
 DRIFTED
 BACK
 TO HIS
 BRIEF
 BUT
 FATEFUL
 CONVERSATION
 WITH
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 AND
 REMEMBERED
 ANOTHER
 PART
 OF WHAT
 HE HAD TOLD HIM: 

- THE
 CONTRACT
 OF EVERY
 SOUL
 COMING
 TO EARTH
 CONTAINS
 CERTAIN
 DETAILS
 RELATING
 TO ITS
 STAY
 AND
 EXPERIENCE
 HERE.
 AND
 THE
 SO-CALLED
 SYNCHRONICITY
 OR COINCIDENCE
 OF EVENTS
 ... HERE
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 LOOKED
 AT THE
 PRIEST
 WITH
 A VAGUE
 UNEASINESS
 - IT SEEMED
 TO HIM
 THAT
 THIS
 CLERGYMAN
 KNEW
 MORE
 ABOUT
 HIM
 EVEN THAN
 HIMSELF. 
175 
 - "BELIEVE
 ME,
 DETECTIVES,
 THESE
 LITTLE
 SIGNS
 OF FATE
 ARE
 OF GREAT
 SIGNIFICANCE,"
 THE
 CLERGYMAN
 GRUNTED,
 "AND
 THEY
 ARE
 NOT
 COINCIDENTAL
 BY ANY
 STRETCH
 OF THE
 IMAGINATION
 - THEY
 ARE
 JUST
 LITTLE
 GUIDANCE
 FROM
 OUR
 GUARDIANS." 
DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 WAS
 PLUNGED
 INTO
 THE
 TWILIGHT
 OF THE
 BEAUTIFULLY
 FURNISHED,
 IF SLIGHTLY
 SPARSE
 BY MUNDANE
 STANDARDS,
 ROOM. 
- "IN FACT,
 OUR
 WHOLE
 JOURNEY
 IS ONE
 ENDLESS
 BIRTH,"
 THE
 CLERIC
 CONCLUDED. 
DONOVAN
 THANKED
 HIM
 AND
 POLITELY
 DECLINED
 HIS
 INVITATION
 TO TAKE
 SOME
 OF THE
 DELICIOUS
 BISCUITS
 AND
 SAMPLE
 HIS
 TEA.
 HE DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO BE TAKEN
 FOR AN INTRUDER
 - AND
 ALL
 THE
 WHILE
 HE WAS
 TAKING
 THE
 MOST
 CAREFUL
 NOTES
 ON THOSE
 THEOLOGICAL
 COMMENTS
 THAT
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 ADDED
 SUBSTANCE
 TO HIS
 QUESTIONS
 ABOUT
 THE
 INVESTIGATION
 OF THE
 CASE. 

INCIDENTALLY,
 THE
 ABBEY
 WAS
 IN A RATHER
 PICTURESQUE
 LOCATION,
 AND
 DONOVAN
 HAD
 GONE
 THERE
 INCOGNITO
 SO AS NOT
 TO ATTRACT
 UNDUE ATTENTION. 

AFTER
 THE
 CONVERSATION
 WAS
 OVER,
 DONOVAN
 SHOOK
 HANDS
 RESPECTFULLY
 WITH
 THE
 PRIEST
 AND
 LEFT.
 AND
 THE
 TWO
 SAW
 NO MORE
 OF EACH
 OTHER. 
THIS
 EPISODE
 PASSED
 THROUGH
 THE
 MIND
 OF FATHER
 TOBIAS. 

ON HIS
 WAY
 OUT,
 THE
 FATHER
 TURNED
 TO THE
 DETECTIVE: 

- TAKE
 A WORD
 OF ADVICE
 FROM
 PROFESSIONAL
 TO PROFESSIONAL
 - DON'T
 GAMBLE
 WITH
 YOUR
 FATE
 DETECTIVES.
 THESE
 THINGS
 ARE
 BIGGER
 THAN
 US. 
ZONARA
 PREPARED
 TO LEAVE
 AND
 TURNED
 TO ME: 176 
 - LET'S
 GO PACK
 OUR
 BAGS
 - THEY'LL
 PROBABLY
 BE HERE
 ANY
 MINUTE
 AND
 THEY'RE
 HARDLY
 IN THE
 MOOD
 TO WAIT
 FOR US. 
YES, SHE
 STILL
 HAD
 A HUGE
 AMOUNT
 OF CASH
 IN THAT
 SUITCASE-BAG
 - THERE
 WAS
 PROBABLY
 ABOUT
 TWO
 MILLION
 DOLLARS
 IN CASH,
 AND
 IN THE
 OTHER
 ONE
 - WERE
 HER
 CLOTHES
 AND
 ACCESSORIES,
 WHICH
 WERE
 NOT
 MUCH
 AT ALL
 - BUT
 STILL,
 SHE
 WAS
 A LADY
 WHO
 WAS
 USED
 TO SPARTAN
 LIVING
 CONDITIONS. 
ARLO,
 LIKE
 EVERY
 HIPSTER,
 WORE
 ALMOST
 ONLY
 THE
 CLOTHES
 ON HIS
 BACK
 AND
 HAD
 HIDDEN
 THE
 MANY
 BILLS
 FROM
 THE
 SALE
 OF MARIJUANA
 IN SPECIAL
 SECRET
 POCKETS. 
THEN
 I WONDERED
 HOW
 WELL
 I ACTUALLY
 KNEW
 MY COMPANIONS
 - YES, THEY
 HAD
 HELPED
 ME THROUGH
 DIFFICULT
 TIMES.
 YES, THEY
 HAD
 EVEN PARTICIPATED
 IN THE
 DREADED
 ASTRAL
 JOURNEY
 TO THE
 REMOTE
 INDIAN
 CEMETERY
 ON MADELINE
 ISLAND.
 EVEN ARLO
 HAD
 CARED
 FOR A BLUEBIRD
 TO PROVE
 HIS
 AFFECTION
 FOR HIS
 TEACHER,
 AND
 HAD
 CHANGED
 THE
 BANDAGES
 AND
 BANDAGES
 THAT
 COVERED
 HIS
 .38
 CALIBER
 SMITH
 & WESSON
 WOUNDS. 
ARLO
 HAD NEVER
 COMPLAINED
 ABOUT
 HAVING
 TO TREAT
 THE
 WOUNDS
 TO PREVENT
 WHAT
 HE CALLED
 PRIMARY
 TISSUE
 NECROSIS
 FROM
 FORMING,
 WHICH
 WOULD
 HAVE
 RESULTED
 IN AMPUTATION
 OF THE
 LIMB
 IN QUESTION. 

THE
 TRUTH
 WAS
 THAT
 BLUEBIRD
 HAD
 A SOUL
 - STRONGER
 THAN
 A LARGE
 PRAIRIE
 BISON,
 FOR AFTER
 SIX
 GUNSHOT
 WOUNDS
 - TWO
 OF THEM
 TO THE
 SUFFERER'S
 TORSO,
 HE HAD
 MANAGED
 TO SURVIVE. 
- "HE HAD
 BEEN
 PURSUED
 BRUTALLY.
 HIS
 PICKUP
 HAD
 BEEN HIT
 REPEATEDLY
 BY THE
 VILLAINS,"
 ARLO
 REPEATED
 THIS
 MORNING,
 SHORTLY
 BEFORE
 HIS
 DEPARTURE.
 "HIS
 ARMOR
 WAS
 HORRIBLY
 DENTED.
 IT'S
 177 
 A MIRACLE
 HE'S
 STILL
 WITH
 US.
 HE HAS
 THE
 SOUL
 OF A STERN
 WARRIOR!
 BUT HIS
 SPIRIT
 WILL
 NEVER
 ... HE TOLD
 ME THAT
 ON THE
 WAY
 TO LITTLE
 CREEK
23 THEY
 HAD
 CAUGHT
 UP WITH
 HIM
 AND
 THE
 SHOW
 HAD
 BEGUN.
 SOMEWHERE
 IN THERE,
 A BRUTAL
 SHOOTOUT
 WAS
 TIED
 UP.
 EVEN BLUEBIRD
 HAD
 TO USE
 OKICHITAU
24 TO DEFEND
 HIMSELF,
 BUT
 ONLY
 PROVIDENCE
 GOT RID
 OF THEM
 AFTERWARDS.
 THAT'S
 WHAT
 HE TOLD
 ME. HE OBVIOUSLY
 DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO REMEMBER
 THE
 WHOLE
 INCIDENT,
 BUT
 PREFERRED
 TO SHAKE
 OFF THE
 PAST." 
I THOUGHT
 ABOUT
 ARLO'S
 WORDS
 - LITTLE
 CREEK
 WAS
 A PICTURESQUE
 AND
 RATHER
 PLEASANT
 PLACE.
 A PARADISE
 FOR THE
 FAMILY.
 WHY
 HAD
 THOSE
 THUGS
 ATTACKED
 HIM
 THERE?
 AND
 WHO
 HAD
 INFORMED
 THEM
 THAT
 A BLUEBIRD
 WAS
 GOING
 TO DROP
 BY? 
UNLESS...
 BLUEBIRD
 KNEW
 EVERYTHING
 BEFORE
 WE DID
 - THAT
 IS,
 HE HAD
 DONE
 THE
 JOB... 
THE
 NOISE
 OF THE
 ONCOMING
 MOTORCYCLES
 DROWNED
 OUT
 HIS
 VOICE.
 THE
 ROCKERS
 WERE
 RAISING
 A FOGHORN
 AND
 COULD
 BE SEEN FROM
 MORE
 THAN
 A MILE
 AWAY,
 BUT WHO
 KNOWS
 WHY
 I HAD
 THE
 VAGUE
 FEELING
 THAT
 SOON
 THINGS
 WOULD
 GO COMPLETELY
 WRONG
 AND
 NOTHING
 WOULD
 BE ABLE
 TO REPAIR
 THE
 DAMAGE
 ANY MORE. 
ARLO
 WASN'T
 HIGH,
 NOR
 WAS
 HE DRUNK, AND
 FROM
 WHAT
 I'D
 SEEN,
 HE'D
 MASTERED
 ASTRAL
 TRAVEL
 ON A GOOD
 BASIC
 LEVEL,
 AND
 MAYBE
 EVEN A MORE
 ADVANCED
 LEVEL,
 BUT WE SHARED
 A DIRTY
 SECRET
 BETWEEN
 US,
 THAT
 OF HIS
 BETRAYAL. 
IT WAS
 A MATTER
 OF TIME
 FOR ANOTHER
 REARRANGEMENT
 OF THE
 DECK
 OF CARDS.
 AND
 THEN
                                                
 23 It's about family camping in Missouri. 
24 Indian martial art. 
178 
 EVERYONE
 WOULD
 FIGHT
 FOR
 THEIR
 OWN
 SURVIVAL.
 AND
 THE
 RIGHT
 TO
 LIVE! 
ZONARA
 WAS
 THE
 MOST
 INSCRUTABLE
 OF THE
 THREE,
 BUT I SUSPECTED
 THAT
 SOONER
 OR LATER
 HER
 SHELL
 WOULD
 ALSO
 CRACK
 AND
 THE
 TRUTH
 WOULD
 EMERGE
 - LIKE
 A PEELED
 ONION,
 ON WHICH
 WHEN
 YOU
 GRADUALLY
 REMOVE
 ALL
 THE
 LAYERS
 - IN THE
 END
 THERE
 IS NOTHING
 LEFT.
 PERHAPS
 THERE
 WAS
 AN OVERWHELMING
 EMPTINESS
 RAGING
 IN HER
 SOUL,
 OR PERHAPS
 SOMETHING
 EVEN WORSE.
 PERHAPS
 SHE
 WAS
 SEEKING
 TRUE
 SALVATION
 FOR
 HER
 OWN
 SOUL
 AND
 HER
 SOUL
 ALONE? 
THE
 ROCKERS
 ARRIVED
 ON THEIR
 IRON
 HORSES-EACH
 OF THEM
 ARMED-AND
 EXPRESSED
 THEIR
 WILLINGNESS
 TO ACCOMPANY
 US,
 BUT NATURALLY
 DEMANDED
 A SMALL
 ADVANCE-APPROXIMATELY
 TWENTY-FIVE
 THOUSAND
 DOLLARS. 
THE
 ZONE
 HAD
 ANTICIPATED
 SUCH
 A REQUEST
 ON THEIR
 PART
 AND
 HAD
 PREPARED
 THE
 KESHENA. 
THE
 ROCKERS
 DECIDED
 THAT
 WE COULD
 FOLLOW
 THE
 MAIN
 THOROUGHFARES,
 AND
 IN ORDER
 NOT
 TO BE SO CONSPICUOUS
 SOME
 OF THE
 MEMBERS
 OF THE
 FORMATION
 WOULD
 LINE
 UP AND
 SWITCH
 PLACES
 - THAT
 WAY
 THE
 THREE
 OF US WOULD
 REMAIN
 RELATIVELY
 UNNOTICED.
 THE
 IDEA
 WASN'T
 BRILLIANT,
 BUT IT WASN'T
 THAT
 BAD
 EITHER. 
WE ALSO
 HAD
 A FEW
 SECONDS
 TO LOOK
 AT THE
 SKULLS,
 WHICH
 WERE
 A DISTINCTIVE
 FEATURE
 IN THE
 SYMBOLISM
 OF THE
 HELLS
 ANGELS.
 THEIR
 STORY
 WAS
 INTERESTING
 AS THEY
 EXPRESSED
 REBELLION
 AND
 RENEGADEISM.
 THE
 RENEGADE
 WAS
 A KIND
 OF APOSTATE
 WHO
 LIVED
 BY HIS
 OWN
 RULES. 
THEN
 SUDDENLY
 SOME
 ARROW
 STU
CK IN THE
 HEART
 OF A BLUEBIRD.
 HE CLUTCHED
 AT HIS
 CHEST
 AND
 HIS
 LEGS
 BUCKLED.
 IT WAS
 FROM
 A CROSSBOW,
 BUT WE COULD
 179 
 NOT
 SEE THE
 ARCHER;
 HE WAS
 HARDLY
 MORE
 THAN
 THREE
 HUNDRED
 TO FIVE
 HUNDRED
 YARDS
 AWAY.
 OF COURSE,
 ZONARA
 COULD
 HAVE
 RESURRECTED
 HIM
 AGAIN,
 BUT
 IT WOULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 MUCH
 HARDER
 THIS
 TIME. 

BLUEBIRD
 TURNED
 TO HER
 AND
 ANSWERED: 
- DON'T
 WASTE
 YOUR
 STRENGTH
 WITH
 ME! YOU
 WILL
 NEED
 IT!
 WALK
 THE
 PATH
 OF YOUR
 OWN
 SALVATION! 
AND
 FELL
 TO THE
 GROUND
 DEAD. 
WHOEVER
 HAD
 FIRED
 THE
 SHOT
 WAS
 EXTREMELY
 TREACHEROUS
 AND BRUTALLY
 VILE.
 THE
 ROCKERS
 INSTANTLY
 DUCKED
 BEHIND
 THEIR
 VEHICLES
 AND
 DREW
 THEIR
 WEAPONS,
 AIMING
 AT THE
 UNSEEN
 ENEMY. 
I NOW
 THOUGHT
 OF THE
 FEDERAL
 AGENTS
 WHO
 MIGHT
 WANT
 TO MAKE
 SOME
 SPECIFIC
 ATTACK
 AND
 SOAK
 THE
 ROCKERS
 FOR IT.
 THAT
 SOUNDED
 PRETTY
 WHACKED
 OUT,
 BUT
 WHO
 WOULD
 BELIEVE
 A BUNCH OF POGROM
 MONGERS?
 WHO
 WAS
 GOING
 TO JUSTIFY
 THEIR
 SHOWING
 UP ON AN INDIAN
 RESERVATION
 IN THE
 EARLY
 WINTER
 MORNING
 - ESPECIALLY
 SINCE
 BLUEBIRD
 WAS
 SHOT
 WITH
 A CROSSBOW
 - THE
 GOAL
 BEING
 THAT
 THE
 WEAPON
 COULD
 NOT
 BE USED
 TO IDENTIFY
 THE
 CRIME. 
THE
 KILLER
 DID
 NOT
 PRODUCE
 THE
 SO-CALLED
 CONTROL
 SHOT
 PERHAPS
 FEARING
 THE
 NOISE
 OF THE
 POLYSPASTIC
 BOWSTRING
 WOULD
 GIVE
 HIM
 AWAY.
 HOW
 DID
 I FIND
 OUT,
 YOU
 ASK?
 WELL,
 THAT
 KIND
 OF SHOT
 POWER
 JUST
 COULDN'T
 BE ACHIEVED
 WITH
 A REGULAR
 ONE.
 THE
 ARROW
 HAD
 A SPECIAL
 CUSTOM
 CARBON
 TIP
 REINFORCED
 WITH
 TITANIUM.
 IT WAS
 DESIGNED
 TO BURST
 THE
 VICTIM'S
 HEART. 
IT COULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 LIKE
 A FUCKING
 RAMBO
25 MOVIE,
 BUT IT WASN'T.
 THIS
 WAS
 THE
 SITUATION
 WHERE
 WE                                                
 25 A famous American action film.
 180 
 FELT
 THE
 NOOSE
 TIGHTENING
 AND
 JUST
 KNEW
 THE
 MOME
NT TO FACE
 THE
 TRUTH
 WAS
 COMING. 
I THOUGHT
 THEN
 THAT
 TOMORROW
 MIGHT
 NEVER
 COME.
 WE WERE
 TEMPORARY
 VISITORS
 IN A WORLD
 WE DIDN'T
 UNDERSTAND
 AND
 DIDN'T
 KNOW
 IF AT ONE
 PARTICULAR
 MOMENT
 IN TIME
 IT WOULD
 BE DESTROYED
 AND
 ALL
 INFORMATION
 ABOUT
 EVERYTHING
 IN IT ERASED
 FOREVER.
 I LAY
 DOWN
 INSTINCTIVELY
 TO PROTECT
 MYSELF. 
I WONDERED
 IF FELISTER
 HAD
 ANYTHING
 IN HIS
 HEART
 AT THE
 MOMENT
 OF HIS
 DEATH?
 DID
 HE FEEL
 A TRACE
 OF SADNESS,
 HATRED
 OR REMORSE?
 FELISTER
 WAS
 THE
 KING
 OF GLOOM
 AND
 THE
 MOST
 EXPERIENCED
 SWINEHERD
 IN THE
 LAND,
 AND
 ... WE THREW
 OURSELVES
 ON THE
 ROCKERS,
 SUPPOSING
 THERE
 WOULD
 BE FURTHER
 ASSASSINATIONS
 AGAINST
 US UNTIL
 WE REACHED
 OUR
 DESTINATION. 
DURAITH
 AND
 ELLER
 WERE
 SKILLED
 MARKSMEN
 WHO
 STUCK
 AROUND
 AND
 OPENED
 FIRE,
 BUT
 THE
 RANGE
 OF THE
 PUMP
 SHOTGUNS
 WAS
 SIMPLY
 INSUFFICIENT. 
SURE
 THE
 COPS
 WOULD
 COME
 SOON,
 BUT
 WE WERE
 STILL
 IN THE
 MIDDLE
 OF NOWHERE,
 AND
 EVEN
 THE
 KESHENA
 WAS
 AT LEAST
 TWO
 OR THREE
 MILES
 AWAY,
 MAYBE
 MORE
 - SO WE HAD
 AT LEAST
 A FEW
 SECONDS
 TO REACT. 
THE
 FEELING
 OF RIDING
 AN IRON
 HORSE
 WAS
 GREAT
 - TO FEEL
 LIKE
 YOU
 DIDN'T
 BELONG
 ANYWHERE
 OR TO ANYONE.
 MOST
 OF THE
 GANG
 MEMBERS
 KNEW
 EACH
 OTHER
 RELATIVELY
 VAGUELY,
 AS SOME
 MEMBERS
 DIDN'T
 LIVE
 MORE
 THAN
 A YEAR
 OR TWO
 BEFORE
 FALLING
 VICTIM
 DURING
 ONE
 OF THEIR
 POGROMS.
 WE DECIDED
 TO TAKE
 HIGHWAY
 55, AND
 SOMEWHERE
 TOWARDS
 NASHVILLE,
 CHANGE
 OUR
 ROUTE
 UNPREDICTABLY
 IN A DESPERATE
 ATTEMPT
 TO GET
 AWAY.
 NOT
 THAT
 THE
 STATE
 GOVERNMENT
 WASN'T
 181 
 GOING
 TO DROP
 SOME
 ON OUR
 HEELS,
 BUT
 STILL,
 WISCONSIN
 WAS
 A RELATIVELY
 LARGE
 STATE
 - WITH
 AN AREA
 LARGER
 THAN
 THAT
 OF THE
 CUBE. 
ELLER
 MENTALLY
 WANTED
 TO DRAW
 A SNOTTY
 CURSE
 FOR ACCEPTING
 TO BE INVOLVED
 AT ALL
 IN THIS
 WHOLE
 RIDICULOUS
 AND
 MESSED UP STORY,
 BUT
 HE WAS
 OBLIVIO
US TO THE
 INVISIBLE
 HAND
 THAT
 STILL
 SEEMED
 TO BE HOLDING
 THEM
 AND
 SEEMED TO BE WEIGHING
 THEIR
 LIVES
 IN THE
 BALANCE.
 DURAITH
 RODE
 BESIDE
 HIM
 IN SILENCE,
 BUT
 SPARKS
 SEEMED TO FLY
 BETWEEN
 THEM.
 IT WAS
 THE
 FIRST
 TIME
 THE
 GANG
 MEMBERS
 HAD
 ESCORTED
 SOMEONE
 LIKE
 US,
 AND
 DESPITE
 THE
 HEFTY
 PAY
 AND
 PROMISE
 OF BOOTY,
 I COULDN'T
 HELP
 BUT
 BET
 THEY
 MIGHT
 JUST
 DUMP
 US SOMEWHERE
 ALONG
 THE
 WAY
 AND FORGET
 ABOUT
 THE
 ARRANGEMENT
 BETWEEN
 US.
 THE
 ROCKERS'
 HAIRSTYLES
 EXPRESSED
 THEIR
 INDIVIDUALITY,
 BUT
 THEIR
 REBELLIOUSNESS
 AND
 ANARCHISM
 WERE
 ALSO
 CLEARLY
 EVIDENT. 
SURELY
 A SINGING
 SHADOW
 WAS
 SOBBING
 UNCONTROLLABLY
 OVER
 ITS
 SON,
 YET
 I NOTICED
 ITS
 RETREAT
 EVEN DURING
 THE
 RESURRECTION
 RITUAL.
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND,
 SHE
 HADN'T
 EVEN MENTIONED
 IT TO US. 
AS THE
 ROCKERS
 RODE
 US AROUND
 ON THEIR
 IMPRESSIVE
 MOTORCYCLES,
 I NOTICED
 THEIR
 STONY
 EXPRESSIONS
 - THEY
 WERE
 IMPENETRABLE,
 AS IF THEY
 WERE
 UNEARTHLY
 BEINGS
 FROZEN
 IN SOME
 STATIC
 STATE,
 AND
 THEY
 REALLY
 LOOKED
 TO ME LIKE
 DEMONS
 STRAIGHT
 OUT
 OF HELL.
 BUT
 I DECIDED
 TO REMIND
 MYSELF
 OF WHAT
 I ACTUAL
LY KNEW
 ABOUT
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 AND
 BLUEBIRD
 - YES, THE
 TWO
 WERE
 FRIENDS,
 BUT
 THEIR
 FRIENDSHIP
 STILL
 AROUSED
 SOME
 SUSPICIONS
 IN ME.
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 HAD
 SHOWN
 NO DESIRE
 FOR
 ENLIGHTENMENT,
 BUT
 HE'D
 GOTTEN
 THE
 ROCKER
 GANG
 TO FOLLOW
 HIM
 LIKE
 FRIGHTENED
 PALLETS
 DEMONSTRATING
 LOYALTY
 TO THEIR
 MASTER. 
182 
 A THOUGHT
 PASSED
 MY WAY
 FROM
 JACK
 KEROUAC'S
 GREAT
 BOOK,
 THAT
 THAT
 PART
 OF HIS
 LIFE
 BEGAN
 AFTER
 A CERTAIN
 MAN
 APPEARED
 - ON THE
 ROAD.
 THE
 WHOLE
 SITUATION
 SEEMED
 LIKE
 AN OXYMORON,
 BUT
 THE
 REALITY
 WAS
 MORE
 THAN
 FRIGHTENING. 
I KNEW THAT
 NASHVILLE
 WASN'T
 THAT
 FAR
 FROM
 THE
 KESHENA,
 BUT IT WAS
 UP AND
 DOWN
 THE
 MIDDLE
 OF OUR
 JOURNEY
 - ABOUT
 SIXTY
 MILES
 AWAY. 
AGAIN
 ANOTHER
 PASSAGE
 FROM
 KEROUAC
26 PASSED
 THROUGH
 MY MIND,
 NAMELY,
 THAT
 HE FELT
 THE
 ROAD
 IN ITS
 IMMENSITY. 
DID
 IT MATTER,
 THEN,
 ALL THOSE
 FACES
 THAT
 PASSED
 US BY,
 AND
 FROM
 WHOM
 WE SOMETIMES
 DREW
 ENERGY
 TO LIVE.
 IT WAS
 DAMNED
 STRANGE,
 BUT ZONARA
 SHED
 NOT
 A TEAR
 FOR THE
 BLUEBIRD,
 AND
 SHORTLY
 BEFORE
 THE
 SKIRMISH
 BETWEEN
 THE
 ROCKERS
 AND
 THE
 INVISIBLE
 ENEMY
 WAS
 TIED
 UP,
 THE
 MENOMINEE
 INDIANS
 HAD
 PROMISED
 TO BURY HIM
 ON THE
 RESERVATION,
 AS IT WAS
 MOST
 FITTING. 
ELLER
 RODE
 WITH
 DIGNITY,
 BUT
 ALSO
 WITH THE
 UNDERSTANDING
 AND CLEAR
 SENSE
 THAT
 SOMETHING
 WAS
 AMISS,
 TO SAY
 THE
 LEAST.
 USUALLY
 IT WASN'T
 OUT
 OF THE
 QUESTION
 FOR EVEN
 THE
 FEDS
 TO GET
 INVOLVED,
 AND
 IN THIS
 CASE,
 THERE
 WAS
 NOTHING
 BUT
 THE
 WIND
 RUFFLING
 HIS
 BLOND
 HAIR. 
ELLER
 WAS
 A LONER,
 AND
 HIS
 RISE
 TO SECOND
 IN COMMAND
 OF THE
 GANG
 WAS
 THE
 GREATEST
 ACHIEVEMENT
 OF HIS
 LIFE,
 BUT
 HE REMEMBERED
 WHAT
 DURAITH
 HAD
 TOLD
 HIM
 ABOUT
 GUS
 BENZOUR
'S STRANGE
 PROPOSITION. 
"DAMN
 THE
 FARMER!"
 HE THOUGHT,
 BUT
 THEN
 STEELED
 HIMSELF,
 "AND
 HOW
 DO THEY
 KNOW
 DURAITH!
 WELL,
 IF                                                
 26 It's about Jack Kerouac's great book "On the Road". 
183 
 EVEN OUR
 VERY
 THOUGHTS
 DRAW
 THE
 REALITY,
 THEN
 WE MUST
 BE VERY
 CAREFUL!" 
IN COMPARATIVE
 PROXIMITY
 TO NASHVILLE
 WAS
 PELICAN
 LAKE,
 WHICH
 WAS
 PRACTICALLY
 UNCEDED
 TERRITORY,
 AND
 CERTAINLY
 OF PECULIAR
 STATUS.
 SOMETHING
 INSIDE
 SEEMED
 TO PUSH
 HIM
 TO STOP
 THERE
 TO CLEAR
 UP THE
 MATTER
 OF THE
 DURAITH,
 BUT THE
 INVISIBLE
 HAND
 WAS
 PUSHING
 HIM
 TO DRIVE
 ON.
 THERE
 WAS
 STILL
 A WAYS
 TO GO TO NASHVILLE,
 AND
 THE
 MOTORCYCLES
 WERE
 MOVING
 AT A DEVILISH
 SPEED. 

WITHIN
 THE
 CONFINES
 OF NASHVILLE,
 HOWEVER,
 WAS
 ANOTHER
 INDIAN
 RESERVATION
 THAT
 BORE
 THE
 NAME
 OF MOLE
 LAKE.
 IT WAS
 WORTH
 ASKING
 AROUND,
 AND
 SURELY
 THEY
 WOULD
 HAVE
 HEARD
 THIS
 OR THAT,
 BUT
 THEY
 WERE
 WORRIED
 ABOUT
 THEIR
 COMPANIONS.
 ELLER
 SUSPECTED
 SOMETHING
 WAS
 STIRRING,
 AND
 WOULDN'T
 HAVE
 BEEN
 SURPRISED
 AT ALL
 IF GUS
 AND
 DURAITH
 HIMSELF
 HAD
 CONSPIRED
 TO REMOVE
 IT AND
 COLLECT
 THE
 LOOT. 
BUT WHERE
 WERE
 HIS
 SUCH
 DELUSIONAL
 THOUGHTS
 COMING
 FROM?
 PERHAPS
 THE
 UNSEEN
 DEMON
 WAS INSTILLING
 THEM
 IN HIM,
 DESIRING
 TO DIVERT
 HIM
 FROM
 HIS
 PATH
 AND
 DESTROY
 HIM-
TO DESTROY
 HIS
 IMMORTAL
 SOUL
 IN ONE
 FELL
 SWOOP. 
- "A
 MAN
 CAN
 ONLY
 LOVE
 ONCE,
 BUT HOW
 TRUE
 IS THAT
 LOVE
?," WHISPERED
 ELLER,
 DRIVING
 LIKE
 A MADMAN,
 "AND
 WHERE
 WILL
 FALSEHOOD
 AND
 LIES
 LEAD
 US? 
AT ONE
 TIME
 THEY
 HEARD
 THE
 POLICE
 SIREN
 SOMEWHERE
 NOT
 FAR
 FROM
 THEM,
 AND
 DECIDED
 TO SWERVE
 DOWN
 A SIDE
 ROAD
 - AND
 THAT
 SAVED
 THEM. 
THERE
 WAS
 A SMALL
 GROVE
 - THE
 ROCKERS
 RAN STRAIGHT
 INTO
 IT.
 THE
 GANG
 WAS
 TOO BIG,
 BUT
 SOMEHOW
 THEY
 MANAGED
 TO GET
 IN THERE. 
184 
 THE
 ENORMOUS
 RISK
 MADE
 ELLER
 WONDER
 IF IT WAS
 WORTH
 DYING
 FOR SOME
 MEASLY
 TWENTY-FIVE
 THOUSAND
 DOLLARS
 - THAT,
 DIVIDED
 AMONG
 THE
 GANG
 MEMBERS,
 WAS
 JUST
 PALTRY
 COMPENSATION,
 BUT AGAIN
 HE REMEMBERED
 THE
 HIDDEN
 POWER. 
THEN
 SOME
 VOICE
 IN HIS
 HEAD
 SPOKE
 THAT
 HE SHOULD
 JUST
 REMOVE
 THE
 DURAITH
 HIMSELF
 - YES,
 THAT
 CUNNING
 AND
 BRUTAL
 TYPE
 WAS
 THE
 CULPRIT
 FOR
 ALL
 HIS
 SUFFERING.
 NATURALLY,
 WE WERE
 AROUND
 PELICAN
 LAKE. 
THEN,
 AS IF OUT
 OF
 NOWHERE,
 A CRAZY
 ARGUMENT
 BROKE
 OUT
 BETWEEN
 ELLER
 AND
 DUREITH
 - THEY
 CLEARLY
 HATED
 EACH
 OTHER
 TO DEATH
 AND
 ONE
 HAD
 TO DIE
 FOR THE
 OTHER
 TO LIVE. 
DURAITH
 USED
 OKICHITAU,
 WHICH
 HE HAD
 APPARENTLY
 ACQUIRED
 AS KNOWLEDGE
 WITH THE
 INDIANS,
 AND
 WHAT
 IS CALLED
 PRISON
 ROCK
 - A BRUTAL
 HAND-
TO-HAND
 COMBAT
 METHOD
 - IN ORDER
 TO KNOCK
 THE
 TEETH
 OUT
 OF HIS
 OPPONENT.
 ELLER
 WAS
 A LITTLE
 MORE
 ROBUST,
 BUT
 HIS
 SKILL
 AT FIGHTI
NG WAS
 SHAPED
 IN STIFF
 STREET
 FIGHTING. 
THE
 TWO
 OF THEM
 LOCKED
 LIPS
 TO OUR
 SURPRISE,
 WHILE
 THE
 REST
 OF THE
 GROUP
 AWAITED
 THE
 DENOUEMENT
 - FRANKLY,
 EVEN THEY
 WERE
 SURPRISED
 THAT
 THE
 MELEE
 HAD
 BROKEN
 OUT
 AT THIS
 PRECISE
 MOMENT,
 BUT
 APPARENTLY
 NO ONE
 CARED
 ALL THAT
 MUCH.
 THEY
 WERE
 OVERCOME
 WITH
 A STRANGE
 EUPHORIA
 - THEY
 WANTED
 BLOOD!
 THE
 BLOOD
 OF ONE
 OF THE
 TWO! 
ELLER
 WAS
 ALSO
 SLIGHTLY
 TALLER
 THAN
 DURAITH,
 BUT THE
 DIFFERENCE
 IN HEIGHT
 WAS
 OFFSET
 BY THE
 LATTER'S
 AGILITY.
 WHAT
 HAPPENED,
 HOWEVER,
 SURPRISED
 EVERYONE.
 SUDDENLY,
 ELLER
 STOPPED
 AND,
 AS IF TO JUSTIFY
 HIMSELF,
 SAID: 
- FORGET
 IT!
 IT WAS
 OBVIOUSLY
 MY FAULT! 
185 
 SUCH
 A FALL
 COULD
 NOT
 BE FORGIVEN
 BY THE
 OTHERS
 AND
 ELER
 WAS
 SIMPLY
 IMPALED
 BY THEIR
 WEAPONS. 
- "HOW
 DID
 DURAITH,
 WHO
 SEEMED
 TO HAVE
 BEEN
 ADOPTED
 BY THE GANG,
 AFTER
 HIS
 EXIT
 FROM
 ADMAX,
 MANAGE
 TO DO THIS
?," WAS
 MY OPINION. 
ZONARA
 AND
 ARLO
 WERE
 AS IF PINCHED.
 NOW
 DURAITH
 WAS
 GOING
 TO BE THE
 SOLE
 DECISION
 MAKER. 
FOR EDIFICATION,
 THE
 DEAD
 ELER
 WAS
 IMPALED
 ON A STAKE,
 A BARBARIC
 CUSTOM
 MORE
 CHARACTERISTIC
 OF THE
 POPULATION
 ALONG
 THE
 AMAZON
 THAN
 OF A BRUTAL
 MOTORCYCLE
 GANG. 
INTESTINES
 PROTRUDED
 FROM
 HIS
 STOMACH,
 AND
 THEN
 THE
 GANG
 SET FIRE
 TO HIS
 CORPSE
 WITH
 A TUBE
 OF GASOLINE
 - THE
 STENCH
 WAS
 INCREDIBLE,
 DOWNRIGHT
 INTOLERABLE.
 ACCORDING
 TO SCIENTIFIC
 CIRCLES,
 THE
 DECOMPOSED
 HUMAN
 FLESH
 HAD
 SOME
 SORT
 OF SMELL
 THAT
 WAS
 A STRANGE
 MIXTURE
 OF GRASS
 CLIPPINGS
 AND
 FRESH
 FISH,
 BUT
 THE
 SMELL
 OF ALE
 WAS
 INCENTIVE
 ENOUGH
 FOR US TO FLEE
 IN AN ATTEMPT
 TO SAVE
 OURSELVES.
 THE
 TWO
 CHEMICAL
 COMPOUNDS
 CADAVERINE
 AND
 PUTRESCINE
 CONTRIBUTED
 TO THE
 SPECIFIC
 SMELL
 OF DEATH
 - THE
 AROMA
 OF DECAY
 AND
 DECAY. 
DURAITH
 APPROACHED,
 CLEARLY
 FEELING
 DISPLEASED
 AND INDESCRIBABLY
 ANGRY
 WITH
 US,
 THE
 IMAGINARY
 CONSPIRATORS
 WHO
 WERE,
 HOWEVER,
 VERY,
 VERY
 MUCH
 IN TUNE
 WITH
 THE
 PARANORMAL: 
- YOU
 WANTED
 TO DESTROY
 ME! 'YOU
 AND
 YOUR
 DUBIOUS
 SPELLS
 AND
 CHARMS
 DON'T
 WORK
 AGAINST
 DURAITH
 BENSERCRUTER,'
 HE MUTTERED,
 HIS
 WORDS
 REMINISCENT
 OF THE
 FRICTION
 OF BARE
 STEEL
 AGAINST
 ANOTHER
 METAL,
 'LET
 ME SEE YOU
 DIE,
 BUT FIRST
 GIVE
 ME THE
 REST
 OF THE
 MONEY
 - IT MUST
 BE ENOUGH.
 THE
 PROVISO
 FALLS
 AWAY.
 FELISTER
 MAY
 HAVE
 LEFT
 NOTHING!
 DORI
 AND
 PETAK!
 WHY
 DRIVE
 YOU
 186 
 NEARLY
 A HUNDRED
 MORE
 MILES
 AND
 RISK
 A FEDERAL
 INVESTIGATION
 OVER
 SOME
 STUPID
 GHOSTS
 OR WORSE,
 DEMONS?
 IN THAT
 CASE,
 THE
 COPS
 WILL JUST
 BEAT
 US TO DEATH
 WITH
 A MOTIVE
 OF RESISTING! 
WITH
 THOSE
 WORDS,
 HE TUCKED
 AWAY
 ZONARA
'S BAG
 WITH
 A SHARP
 MOVEMENT
 AND
 GASPED
 - THERE
 WERE
 PILES
 OF MONEY
 INSIDE,
 EVEN SMALL
 BARS OF COLLECTIBLE
 GOLD
 - AS MANY
 AS EIGHT
 IN NUMBER. 
HE SHOWED
 IT TO THE
 GANG,
 WHO,
 HOWEVER,
 WERE
 NOT
 PARTICULARLY
 CHARMED.
 AT FIRST,
 THOUGH,
 THEY
 HAD
 WINNING
 SMILES
 ON THEIR
 FACES
 - THEY
 HAD
 OBVIOUSLY
 UN-CONSPIRED
 US - THIS
 WAS
 MUCH
 MORE
 INTERESTING
 TO THEM.
 IF THEY
 LOST
 THEIR
 REPUTATION
 AS TERRIBLE
 ROBBERS
 AND
 RAPISTS,
 THEIR
 LIVES
 WERE
 OVER! 
THE
 ROCKERS
 REALIZED
 THAT
 MANY
 OF THEM
 WOULD
 NOT
 HAVE
 BEEN
 ENTITLED
 TO EVEN THE
 LAST
 MEAL
 THAT
 DEATH
 ROW
 INMATES
 USUALLY
 HOPED
 FOR WITHOUT
 THE
 RIGHT
 TO APPEAL
 IF THE
 STATE
 POLICE
 HAD
 FELT
 LIKE
 SEARCHING
 THE
 LITTLE
 GROVE
 - FORTUNATELY
 THAT
 DIDN'T
 HAPPEN.
 THIS
 AGAIN
 WAS
 COMPLETELY
 INEXPLICABLE. 
USUALLY
 THE
 POLICE
 WOULDN'T
 EVEN
 NEED
 MUCH
 OF AN EXCUSE
 TO SHOOT
 THEM
 LIKE
 DOGS,
 AND
 SOME
 OF THE
 EASIEST
 EXCUSES
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 BEEN
 MAKING
 THREATS
 OR EVEN A TRAFFIC
 VIOLATION.
 THERE
 WAS
 A SO-CALLED
 SCIENCE
 OF "KILLOLOGY
27" THAT
 HAD
 DEVELOPED
 THE
 PERFECT
 INSTINCTS
 IN THE
 POLICE
 IN THIS
 REGARD. 
IN GENERAL,
 DWIGHT
 WAS
 NOT
 THE
 ONLY
 ONE
 WHO
 HAD
 ESCAPED
 DEATH
 MORE
 THAN
 ONCE
 OR TWICE.
 IT WAS
 A BASIC
 PRACTICE
 THAT
 IF SOME
 EX-CONVICT
 OR INMATE
                                                
 27 Killology is the science of killing, created by legendary 
officer 
Dave Grossman. 
187 
 JOINED
 THE
 GROUP,
 HE WOULD
 DESCRIBE
 IN THE
 MOST
 GENER
AL TERMS
 HIS
 PREVIOUS
 CRIMES.
 JEREMY
 EIL
 HAD
 ALSO
 GOTTEN
 AWAY
 WITH
 IT,
 ESCAPING
 WITH
 ROBERT
 CHAMPS
 FROM
 SAN
 QUENTIN,
 A MAXIMUM
 SECURITY
 PRISON
 IN THE
 STATE
 OF CALIFORNIA.
 BOTH
 REMEMBERED
 SHARING
 A CELL
 WHERE
 VIOLENCE
 AND
 PAIN
 WERE
 A DAILY
 OCCURRENCE.
 THE
 GUARDS
 WERE
 HORRIBLE
 AND
 VIOLATED
 THEIR
 HUMAN
 RIGHTS
 WITH
 A RELISH
 THAT
 WAS
 ENDEMIC
 TO BEASTS.
 STILL
 THERE
 THEY
 VOWED
 THAT
 IF THEY
 EVER MANAGED
 TO GET
 FREE
 THEY
 WOULD
 ABIDE
 BY ABSOLUTELY
 NO SOCIAL
 OR SOCIETAL
 NORMS
 - THEY
 WERE
 ALSO
 TWO
 OF THE
 BLADES
 OF THE
 MOTORCYCLE
 GANG
 WHO
 HAD
 PROVEN
 THEIR
 EFFECTIVENESS
 IN OPERATIONS. 
EIL
 AND
 CHAMPS
 HAD
 SHARED
 A CELL
 WITH
 PSYCHOPATHS,
 SERIAL
 KILLERS
 AND
 ABSOLUTE
 MANIACS
 - WITH
 ONE
 OF THEIR
 CELLMATES
 EVEN ATTEMPTING
 TO DETONATE
 A HOMEMADE
 BOMB
 IN THE
 PRISON
 DORMITORY
 - AND
 UNTIL
 NOW
 THERE
 HAD
 BEEN
 LITTLE
 CLARITY
 ON EXACTLY
 HOW
 THIS
 HAD
 HAPPENED
 DESPITE
 DRACONIAN
 SECURITY
 MEASURES. 
THE
 TWO
 MEN
 HAD
 SEEN ALL
 SORTS
 OF SADISTS
 AND
 GANGSTERS,
 BUT
 THEY
 HAD
 NEVER
 WITNESSED
 A TOUGH
 GUY
 LIKE
 ELLER
 GIVE
 UP FIGHTING
 FOR HIS
 LIFE
 JUST
 LIKE
 THAT.
 NO,
 IT WASN'T
 FEAR!
 IT WAS
 JUST
 IMPOSSIBLE!
 HERE
 LAY
 SOMETHING
 ELSE! 
THEY
 REMEMBERED
 HOW,
 IN THE
 SAME
 WAY,
 DURAITH
 HIMSELF
 HAD
 YIELDED
 TO GUS
 BENZOUR. 
THERE
 WAS
 EVEN A SERIAL
 KILLER
 IN THE
 ROCKER
 GROUP,
 JEFFREY
 BANDOW,
 WHO
 HAD
 THREE
 MURDERS
 OF POLICEMEN
 AND
 BY SOME
 MIRACLE
 HAD NOT
 YET
 BEEN
 SHOT.
 THEY
 HAD
 PUT
 A HUGE
 BOUNTY
 ON HIS
 HEAD,
 AND
 HIS
 FACE
 ADORNED
 QUITE
 A FEW
 ROADSIDE
 POLES
 IN AT LEAST
 FIFTEEN
 STATES. 
188 
 AS THEY
 WATCHED
 THE
 UNRESOLVED
 CLASH
 BETWEEN
 THEIR
 LEADERS,
 THESE
 SAVAGE
 DEMIHUMANS
 REALIZED
 THAT
 SOME
 ATROCITY
 WAS
 ABOUT
 TO OCCUR
 THAT
 WOULD
 GO BEYOND
 THE
 REALM
 OF THE
 NORMAL. 

IN SUCH
 A SITUATION,
 A GANGSTER
 GANG
 COULD
 EASILY
 HAVE
 BROKEN
 UP,
 BUT SOMETHING
 INEXPLICABLE
 SEEMED
 TO HOLD
 THEM
 TOGETHER.
 THEY
 DIDN'T
 PULL
 OUT
 THEIR
 GUNS
 IN AN ATTEMPT
 TO SEIZE
 THE
 LOOT
 - THAT
 WOULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 STUPID
 AND
 POINTLESS.
  WE ONLY
 WATCHED
 THEIR
 STRANGE,
 HALF-HUMAN,
 HALF-DEMONIC
 REACTIONS
 OF BAKED
 RECIDIVISTS. 
SUDDENLY,
 SOMEONE
 TURNED
 TO DURAITH
 AND
 GAVE
 HIM
 A PARTICULAR
 LOOK: 
- IF YOU'VE
 ARRANGED
 WITH
 GUS
 HIMSELF
 TO SHARE.
 AND
 EVENTUALLY
 THE
 COPS
 WILL
 BRAZENLY
 NAIL
 US.
 THESE
 DOGS!
 BETTER
 DEATH
 THAN
 TO ... 
DURAITH
 REALIZED
 HE'D
 HAVE
 TO SAVE
 HIS
 LIFE
 - HE COULDN'T
 FACE
 EVERYONE
 ALONE.
 DESPITE
 THE
 MORAL
 SUPERIORITY
 HE IMAGINED
 HE POSSESSED.
 THE
 MACHIAVELLIAN
 SYNDROME
 WAS
 PERFECTLY
 APPLICABLE
 TO THIS
 SORT
 OF PERSON,
 SINCE
 HONESTY
 LED
 NOWHERE
 AND
 DECEIT
 CARRIED
 AT LEAST
 SOME
 CHANCE
 OF SURVIVAL. 
THE
 OTHERS
 DIDN'T
 ATTACK
 HIM,
 BUT
 THEY
 DIDN'T
 DARE
 APPROACH
 HIM
 EITHER.
 IT SEEMED
 ABSOLUTELY
 UNNATURAL.
 PERHAPS
 THEY
 WERE
 LIKE
 A PACK
 OF HYENAS,
 AFRAID
 TO ATTACK
 A DOOMED
 LION
 THAT
 MIGHT
 WELL
 PROVE
 VERY
 DANGEROUS?
 BUT
 DURAITH
 GAVE
 NO SIGN
 OF WANTING
 TO FIGHT
 - YET
 HIS
 WEAPON
 WAS
 AT HAND. 189 
 AT ONE
 TIME
 THE
 ROCKERS
 DID
 NOT
 ENDURE,
 AND
 IT WAS
 JEREMY
 EIL,
 THE
 OUTLAW
 OF SAN
 QUENTIN,
 WHO
 ASKED
 HIM
 SIMPLY 
- ARE
 YOU
 GOING
 TO KEEP
 LEADING
 US OR NOT? 
HE LOOKED
 EVEN MORE
 HAGGAR
D. THE
 MEN DIDN'T
 EVEN LOOK
 AT EACH
 OTHER.
 THEY
 JUST
 GOT ON THEIR
 MOTORCYCLES
 AND
 CONTINUED
 ON,
 BEFORE
 LETTING
 TWO
 OF THE
 FORMATION
 CHECK
 FOR
 A POLICE
 AMBUSH. 

ARLO'S
 MIND
 CRYSTALLIZED
 THE
 CORPSE
 OF ELLAR,
 STRUNG
 LIKE
 A PIECE
 OF FOOD
 ON A SKEWER.
 THE
 CONSUMERIST
 NATURE
 OF SOCIETY
 HAD
 PERHAPS
 LED
 TO THIS
 DOWNFALL?
 ALTHOUGH
 THESE
 SOCIETIES
 HAD
 THEIR
 ORIGINS
 IN THE
 1930S IN THE
 PRESENT
 TECHNOLOGICALLY
 ADVANCED
 TIMES
 THIS
 TENDENCY
 HAD
 INCREASED
 ENORMOUSLY. 
ARLO'S
 MIND
 CRYSTALLIZED
 THE
 CORPSE
 OF AN ELLAR,
 STRUNG
 LIKE
 A PIECE
 OF FOOD
 ON A SKEWER.
 THE
 CONSUMERIST
 NATURE
 OF SOCIETY
 HAD
 PERHAPS
 LED
 TO THIS
 DOWNFALL?
 ALTHOUGH
 THESE
 SOCIETIES
 HAD
 THEIR
 ORIGINS
 IN THE
 1930S IN THE
 PRESENT
 TECHNOLOGICALLY
 ADVANCED
 TIMES
 THIS
 TENDENCY
 HAD
 INCREASED
 ENORMOUSLY. 
WE THEN
 WENT
 OUT
 ON A CIRCUITOUS
 ROUTE
 AND
 DECIDED
 FOR EXTRA
 SECURITY
 NOT
 TO REFUEL
 FOR NOW. 

WE MANAGED
 TO REPLENISH
 OUR
 WATER
 SUPPLY
 FROM
 PELICAN
 LAKE
 ITSELF,
 WHICH
 HAD
 NO VISITORS
 AT THE
 TIME,
 AS WE WERE
 AFRAID
 OF BEING
 RECOGNIZED
 AT A GAS
 STATION. 
MANY
 PROBABLY
 WOULDN'T
 HAVE
 BELIEVED
 IT,
 BUT I WONDERED
 WHERE
 THE
 GAS
 STAYED.
 IN THE
 END
 THERE
 WAS
 ABSOLUTELY
 NOTHING
 KEEPING
 HIM
 ON THE
 RESERVATION,
 AND
 HIS
 FRIEND
 WAS
 FATALLY
 190 
 SHOT.
 HE COULD
 HARDLY
 DO ANY
 BUSINESS
 WITH
 THE
 LOCALS
 ANYMORE
 EITHER
 - SO HIS
 PRESENCE
 THERE
 WAS
 RATHER
 IRRELEVANT. 
YES, BLUEBIRD'S
 WORDS
 THAT
 "THIS
 WINTER
 WOULD
 BE HIS
 LAST"
 PROVED
 PROPHETIC. 
I WONDERED
 IF EACH
 OF US HAD
 SIMPLY
 BUILT
 A MICRO-
WORLD
 OF OUR
 OWN
 IN WHICH
 TO SURVIVE
 - MUCH
 LIKE
 THE
 HOSPITAL
 WALLS
 OF A MENTAL
 INSTITUTION.
 WE FELT
 COMFORTABLE
 JUST
 FINDING
 EXCUSES. 
ZONARE
 DIDN'T
 HAVE
 A PETAC
 NOW,
 AND
 THE
 GROUP
 HAD
 DECIDED
 TO EAT,
 SINCE
 TAKING
 THE
 WHOLE
 DISTANCE
 TO LA POINTE
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 PREVENTED
 THEM
 FROM
 KEEPING
 BETTER
 TRACK
 OF THEIR
 SAFETY. 
SO WE FORCED
 OURSELVES
 TO SPEND
 THE
 EVENING
 LISTENING
 TO FAT
 JOKES
 AND
 BREATHING
 IN THE
 FLAVOR
 OF REAL
 NOMADIC
 LIFE. 
IN THE
 MORNING,
 HOWEVER,
 DURAITH
 HAD
 WANDERED
 OFF
 TO PARTS
 UNKNOWN,
 AND
 THE
 MEMBERS
 OF THE
 GANG
 WERE
 GREATLY
 DISTURBED
 BY HIS
 ABSENCE.
 THEY
 ASSUMED
 THAT
 HE WOULD
 GIVE
 THEM
 AWAY,
 BUT A LITTLE
 LATER
 IT WAS
 LEARNED
 THAT
 EIL
 AND
 SHAMS
 HAD
 TRACKED
 HIM
 DOWN
 AND
 KILLED
 HIM
 IN THE
 NEARBY
 WOODS.
 STRANGE
 WHY,
 BUT
 THIS
 TIME
 THEY
 HAD
 BURIED
 HIS
 CORPSE
 SHALLOWLY,
 DOUSING
 IT WITH
 GASOLINE
 TO PREVENT
 WILD
 ANIMALS
 FROM
 CARRYING
 THE
 PIECES
 OF HIS
 CORPSE
 IN DIFFERENT
 DIRECTIONS
 - AND
 IT MADE
 THE
 BODY
 ROT
 MUCH
 MORE
 QUICKLY
 AND
 EASILY. 

FORTUNATELY,
 NO ONE
 WAS PAYING
 ATTENTION
 - SO I HAD
 PLENTY
 OF TIME
 TO EXAMINE
 THE
 BLUEBIRD
 MASCOT.
 IT WAS
 VERY
 SPECIAL
 AND
 OBVIOUSLY
 SERVED
 AS PROTECTION. 
- "USE
 IT WISELY,"
 THE
 INDIAN
 HAD
 CONCLUDED.
 "IN
 LIFE,
 EVERYONE
 USUALLY
 HAS
 ONE
 CHANCE,
 BUT
 MANY
 191 
 OF US DON'T
 EVEN
 HAVE
 THAT.
 AND
 THE
 GREAT
 SPIRIT
 ..." 
THE
 BLUEBIRD'S
 EYES WERE
 STRANGE
 AS HE HAD IMPARTED
 THIS
 MAGICAL
 REMEDY
 - LIKE
 BOTTOMLESS
 WELLS
 IN WHICH
 YOUR
 PLUNGE
 MIGHT
 BE ENDLESS
 AND
 A SKY
 IN WHICH
 NOT
 A STAR
 REMAINED
 AND A MISTY
 GLOOM
 REIGNED. 
IT WAS
 A MOST
 ORDINARY
 INDIAN
 DREAM-TRAP,
 WHICH
 WAS
 MADE
 OF BRIGHTLY
 COLOURED
 FEATHERS
 SUSPENDED
 UNDER
 A MASSIVE
 WOODEN
 RING
 DECORATED
 WITH
 BEADS
 - IN THE
 MIDDLE
 OF WHICH
 WAS
 VISIBLE
 THE
 WELL-TANGLED
 MANDALA
 THAT
 WAS
 SUPPOSED
 TO CATCH
 BAD
 DREAMS. 
- IN YOUR
 DREAMS
 YOU
 WILL
 FIND
 THE
 TRUE ANSWER
 TO YOUR
 QUESTIONS.
 AND
 THE
 ASTRAL
 WORLD
 WAS
 ONLY
 A TEST
 OF YOUR
 LEVEL
 OF SENSITIVITY
 - HIS
 MOUTH
 STRETCHED
 INTO
 A SEMBLANCE
 OF A FRIENDLY
 SMILE,
 WHICH
 FOR WHO
 KNOWS
 WHY
 I DIDN'T
 FIND
 SO FRIGHTENING. 

AFTER
 THE
 MURDER
 OF DURAITH,
 APPARENTLY
 THE
 BIKERS
 NEEDED
 A NEW
 LEADER
 WHO
 HAD
 TO BE LESS
 PETTY
 ABOUT
 DIVIDING
 THE
 SPOILS
 AND
 THE
 "ADMINISTRATIVE"
 FORMALITIES. 
THEY
 DECIDED
 TO VOTE
 LIKE
 A PRIMITIVE
 RABBLE
 ON WHO
 WAS
 THE
 WORTHIEST,
 AND
 SO THAT
 THERE
 WOULD
 BE NO MORE
 MURDERS
 - THEY
 ESTABLISHED
 A NEW
 SIMP
LE RULE
 - THE
 ONE
 AMONG
 THEM
 WITH
 THE
 MOST
 SERIOUS
 CRIMES
 COULD
 BE CALLED
 A TRUE
 HELL
 ANGEL. 

AFTER
 SOME
 HESITATION,
 THEY
 DECIDED
 THAT
 EIL
 HIMSELF
 MET
 THE
 STANDARD
 FOR SUCH
 AN HONOR
 - HE HAD
 A RECORD
 SO LONG
 THAT
 EVEN JUST
 LISTING
 THE
 CRIMES
 AT THE
 BEGINNING
 SUGGESTED
 THAT
 HE MIGHT
 BE THE
 TRUE
 INCARNATION
 OF THE
 ANTICHRIST
 - HE HAD
 MORE
 THAN
 A DOZEN
 MURDERS,
 TWO
 ROBBERIES,
 192 
 A BURGLARY,
 A DISTURBING
 THE
 PEACE,
 AND
 INVOLVEMENT
 IN A RACKETEERING
 RING
 - THAT
 WAS
 ENOUGH
 TO DECLARE
 HIM
 A WORTHY
 CANDIDATE. 
FATE
 HAD
 SURPRISES
 IN STORE
 FOR
 US... 
THERE
 WASN'T
 TOO
 MUCH
 LEFT
 ON OUR
 ROUTE,
 AND
 NOW
 I NOTICED
 THAT
 THE
 FACES
 OF THE
 OTHER
 MOTORCYCLISTS
 HAD
 BECOME
 MORE
 PECULIAR. 
THAT
 NIGHT
 THEY
 WERE
 BUSY
 DISTRIBUTING
 THE
 SPOILS
 - AND
 THEY
 WERE
 VERY
 INTERESTING.
 THEY
 DECIDED
 BECAUSE
 OF EIL'S
 ACTIVE
 PARTICIPATION
 IN THE
 LIQUIDATION
 OF THE
 DURIGHT
 - HE WOULD
 GET
 THE
 EIGHT
 SMALL
 GOLD
 BARS
 AND
 ALL
 THE
 OTHER
 MONEY
 WAS
 LEFT
 FOR THE
 OTHERS. 
ROBERT
 CHAMPS
 - HIS
 AVER
 RATHER
 ODDLY
 SHUFFLED
 OFF
 AND
 SAID
 NOTHING. 
THEY
 HAD
 BOTH
 SHARED
 THE
 ADVERSITY
 AT SAN
 QUENTIN,
 WHICH
 WAS
 PRACTICALLY
 THE
 OLDEST
 PRISON
 IN CALIFORNIA.
 IT ALSO
 HOUSED
 THE
 SO-CALLED
 DEATH
 CHAMBER.
 BUT BOTH
 CHAMPS
 AND EIL
 PREFERRED
 TO FORGET
 THIS
 EPISODE
 IN THEIR
 LIVES.
 IN THEIR
 DREAMS,
 GLIMPSES
 SOMETIMES
 APPEARED
 OF THE
 OUTLINE
 OF
 THE
 HUGE
 PRISON
 THAT
 HAD
 BEEN
 THEIR
 HOME
 FOR
 MORE
 THAN
 SIXTEEN
 YEARS. 
THERE
 WERE
 NO DISSATISFIED
 PRISONERS. 
BUT ZONARA
 HAD
 BECOME
 SIMPLY
 UNRECOGNIZABLE,
 AND
 ARLO
 HAD
 MANAGED
 TO KEEP
 HIS
 MONEY
 BY INEXPLICABLY
 INSERTING
 IT INTO
 THE
 BARK
 OF A TREE.
 YES, HE SHOULD
 HAVE
 TAKEN
 THEM
 SHORTLY
 BEFORE
 HIS
 DEPARTURE,
 BUT
 HIS
 WIDE
 CLOTHES
 WITH
 MANY
 POCKETS
 WERE
 AN EXCELLENT
 HIDING
 PLACE. 
NATURALLY,
 ARLO
 HADN'T
 BEEN
 SEARCHED
 FOR THE
 SIMPLE
 REASON
 THAT,
 AS A HIPSTER
 AND
 A RATHER
 DEFT
 MANIPULATOR,
 HE WAS
 ADEPT
 AT MAKING
 193 
 CONTACTS
 WHEREVER
 HE WENT
 - GENERALLY,
 THE
 WEED
 HE'D
 SMOKED
 WITH
 THE
 OTHER
 GANG
 MEMBERS
 HAD
 CEMENTED
 HIS
 CONTACTS
 FURTHER. 
ON THE
 MORROW
 WE SET
 OFF,
 AND
 NOW
 HAD
 THE
 LAST
 PART
 OF THE
 JOURNEY
 BEFORE
 REACHING
 OUR
 FINAL
 DESTINATION,
 AS WE THEN
 THOUGHT,
 THE
 LA POINTE
 CEMETERY. 

THE
 ROCKERS
 DECIDED
 TO TAKE
 ROUTE
 EIGHT,
 THEN
 FIFTY-ONE,
 BUT OUR
 GROUP
 WOULD
 SPLIT
 INTO
 TWO
 SEPARATE
 SUB-GROUPS
 TO REASSEMBLE
 AT IRISHWOOD
 - OF COURSE,
 THIS
 WAS
 ONE
 OF THE
 MORE
 OBVIOUS
 ROUTES,
 BUT
 IT HAD
 TO BE CONSIDERED
 AS WE WOULD
 NOT
 BE SUCH
 EASY
 TARGETS
 THIS
 WAY. 
WE SET
 OFF
 AGAIN.
 THIS
 TIME
 I DIDN'T
 FEEL
 ANYTHING
 - THERE
 WAS
 NOTHING
 SO STRANGE.
 I ASSUMED
 THAT
 ARLO
 HAD
 MANAGED
 TO COLLECT
 HIS
 SMALL
 FORTUNE
 FROM
 THE
 BARK
 OF THE
 TREE
 WITHOUT
 THOSE
 BANDITS
 SENSING
 IT - THE
 TAREKAT
 COULD
 STEP
 LIKE
 A CAT
 ON TIPTOE. 

BUT AFTER
 THAT
 ASTRAL
 WALK
 IN THE
 PRESENCE
 OF THE
 NOW-DECEASED
 BLUEBIRD,
 I WAS
 CLEARLY
 AWARE
 THAT
 SOME
 PART
 OF THE
 WHOLE
 PICTURE
 WAS
 STILL
 SLIPPING
 AWAY. 
I DID
 MY BEST
 TO KEEP
 MY FACE
 IMPENETRABLE,
 AND
 THE
 ZONAR
 NEVER
 ONCE
 LOOKED
 AT ME.
 THERE
 WERE
 SOME
 QUIRKS
 THAT
 DEFINITELY
 SEEMED
 TO HAVE
 BUILT
 A NEW
 MICROWORLD
 - THE
 EXTREMELY
 UNEVENTFUL
 MURDER
 OF THE
 DURAITH
 WAS
 JUST
 ONE
 OF THEM. 
AT THE
 END
 OF THE
 DAY
 WE WERE
 IN AYRENWOOD
 - HERE
 THE
 HELL'S
 ANGELS
 GATHERED
 IN ONE
 OF THE
 LOCAL
 PUBS
 AND
 BEHAVED
 MORE
 THAN
 MANNERLY
 - THEY
 COULD
 AFFORD
 A BIT
 OF A 'HOLIDAY'
 AFTER
 THE
 HUGE
 HIT
 ZONARA
'S MONEY
 HAD
 TAKEN.
 THEN
 I SENSED
 THAT
 AN ASSASSINATION
 ATTEMPT
 WAS
 BEING
 MADE
 194 
 AGAINST
 ME - AFTER
 ALL,
 ARLO
 AND
 ZONARA
 WERE
 IN A SEPARATE
 LEAGUE,
 AND
 I'D
 BEEN
 GIVEN
 THE
 BLUEBIRD
 AMULET,
 AND
 HE'D
 PROMISED
 THE
 ANSWER
 TO EVERYTHING
 WOULD
 BE REVEALED
 TO ME VERY
 SOON. 
THE
 ROCKERS
 ENTERED
 AN INTERESTING
 BREWPUB,
 WHERE
 AS MUCH
 AS IT WAS
 NOT
 TO BE BELIEVED,
 THEY
 TRIED
 TO OBSERVE
 SOME
 DISCRETION
 THAT
 WOULD
 MAKE
 THE
 OWNER'S
 EYES
 GLAZE
 OVER
 AND
 HE WOULD
 NOT
 ACCIDENTALLY
 PRESS
 THE
 PANIC
 BUTTON. 
ARLO,
 ZONER
 AND
 I HADN'T
 SAID
 A WORD
 TO EACH
 OTHER
 THE
 ENTIRE
 TRIP,
 BUT
 I FELT
 I HAD
 TO RELY
 ON MORE
 THAN
 THE
 BLUEBIRD
 MEDALLION.
 SO TONIGHT
 I WAS
 GOING
 TO GET
 READY
 AND
 STAY
 ONE
 STEP
 AHEAD
 OF THEM. 
THERE
 WAS
 SOMETHING
 ELSE
 BIG
 BROTHER
 WAS
 GOING
 TO GAIN
 EVEN MORE
 POWER
 AFTER
 BLUEBIRD'S
 DEMISE
 - SO THE
 UNKNOWNS
 IN THE
 EQUATION
 WERE
 BECOMING
 TOO MANY
 AND
 ANY PREDICTIONS
 WERE
 TOO
 DANGEROUS.
 MAYBE
 BIG
 BROTHER
 HAD
 A DARK SIDE
 THAT
 HE WAS
 JEALOUSLY
 HIDING
 FROM
 ALL
 OF US,
 AND
 A SINGING
 SHADOW
 WAS
 GOING
 TO ATONE
 FOR WALKING
 AWAY
 FROM
 HIS
 SON
 IN SOMEONE
 ELSE'S
 LIFE.
 YES,
 LIFE
 WAS
 FOR LIVING
 AND
 IT WAS
 NOT
 ABOUT
 LOVE! 

I SUSPECTED,
 HOWEVER,
 THAT
 THERE
 WAS
 SOMETHING
 ELSE
 BESIDES
 THE
 INVISIBLE
 SUPERNATURAL
 HAND
 THAT
 WAS
 AFTER
 US - AND
 THIS
 ENTITY
 WAS
 OF A PURELY
 HUMAN
 NATURE. 
ZONARA
 WAS
 NOT
 HELPLESS
 AT ALL
 - THOUGH
 WITHOUT
 FINANCIAL
 MEANS,
 SHE
 STILL
 HAD
 MASTERY
 OF HER
 MAGICAL
 RITUALS,
 AND
 ARLO
 COULD
 TIP THE
 SCALES
 AT THE
 APPROPRIATE
 MOMENT,
 OR EVEN
 PLAY
 SOLO,
 WHICH
 WAS
 ALL
 TOO
 LIKELY. 
THE
 LOCALS
 PRETENDED
 NOT
 TO NOTICE
 THE
 RESPECTABLE
 APPEARANCE
 OF THE
 MEN WHO
 JUST
 195 
 PASSED
 BY.
 AS FAR
 AS I CAN
 REMEMBER
 NO ONE
 BOOED
 EITHER.
 IT WAS
 AS IF SOME
 CHILL
 HAD
 PASSED
 THROUGH
 THE
 TOWN
 AND
 LIFE WAS
 ONLY
 POSSIBLE
 IN THOSE
 THIN
 ETHEREAL
 LAYERS
 WHERE
 THOSE
 EXTRAORDINARY
 CREATURES
 DWELT.
 THE
 WIDE
 STREETS
 WERE
 UNUSUALLY
 DESERTED,
 BUT
 THE
 AIR
 REMINDED
 ME OF THAT
 BLUE
 SPRI
NG I HAD
 EXPERIENCED
 ON FELISTER
'S FARM
 - EVEN THOUGH
 THE
 TEMPERATURES
 OUTSIDE
 WERE
 BELOW
 FREEZING
 AND
 IT WAS
 FEBRUARY.
 THE
 FEW
 PEOPLE
 WE MET
 AT ALL,
 CRUISING
 BY ON THEIR
 POWERFUL
 MOTORCYCLES,
 HAD
 THEIR
 HEADS
 BOWED
 - AS IF AWAITING
 THE
 DREADED
 JUDGMENT. 
I HAD
 ONCE
 WATCHED
 SOME
 ALIEN
 ON A TV SHOW
 WHO
 SAID
 THAT
 THE
 UNIVERSE
 DIDN'T
 WANT
 OUR
 SURVIVAL,
 AND
 WE HAD
 TO ESCAPE
 TO ANOTHER
 UNIVERSE
 IF NECESSARY
 - AND SO ON AD INFINITUM,
 AND
 IF WE COULDN'T
 GET
 THERE
 BEFORE
 THE
 END
 OF THE
 CURRENT
 ONE,
 OR THERE
 WAS
 NO SUCH UNIVERSE
 YET,
 WE WOULD
 PERISH.
 QUANTUM
 PHYSICS
 HAD
 SIMILAR
 EXPLANATIONS,
 AND
 A NUMBER
 OF PROMINENT
 SCIENTISTS
 TALKED
 ALONG
 SIMILAR
 LINES. 
WE DECIDED
 TO STAY
 IN A MOTEL,
 WHERE
 I TRIED
 MY HARDEST
 TO CLOSE
 MY EYES
 IN AN ATTEMPT
 TO SLEEP.
 THE
 ROOM
 WAS
 SPARTANLY
 FURNISHED,
 AND
 I BEGAN
 TO APPRECIATE
 FOR THE
 FIRST
 TIME
 THAT
 FELISTER
 HAD
 NEVER
 SPARED
 ANY
 EXPENSE
 TO KEEP
 HIS
 WORKERS
 WELL-EACH
 OF THEM
 HAD
 ACCESS
 TO A SPECIAL
 BATHROOM
 TO WASH
 AWAY
 THE
 PIG
 FILTH-
BUT COULD
 WE WASH
 THE
 FILTH
 FROM
 OUR
 SOULS?
 I DIDN'T
 AT
 FIRST.
 I TRIED
 NOT
 TO LOOK
 AT THE
 DARKNESS
 ABOVE
 ME, AS I KNEW
 IT WOULDN'T
 HELP.
 THEN
 I GOT
 CARRIED
 AWAY.
 AND
 I DID
 INDEED
 GLIMPSE
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 - HIS
 FACE
 WAS
 CHANGED
 AND HE MOVED
 STRANGELY
 - AS IF NOT
 TO BE FELT.
 AND
 DAMN
 THAT
 LOOKED
 LIKE
 LA POINTE.
 THE
 STRANGE
 FARMER
 WHO
 I COULD
 EVEN
 ASSUME
 WAS
 SATAN
 HIMSELF
 CONTINUED
 HIS
 WALK
 AMONG
 THE
 GRAVES. 
196 
 ALL
 THE
 DEMON
 MYTHS
 MAY
 HAVE
 BEEN
 EXAGGERATED,
 BUT
 SOMEWHERE
 IN THERE
 I SENSED
 THAT
 GUS
 BENZOIR
 PROBABLY
 KNEW
 A LOT
 MORE
 THAN
 HE WAS
 LETTING
 ON - DIDN'T
 BLUEBIRD
 HAVE
 THE
 RIGHT
 TO SPEAK
 UP AND
 REVEAL
 THE
 WHOLE
 TRUTH
 TO ME? SURELY
 THIS
 WAS
 PART
 OF THE
 RITUAL,
 OR MY ROAD
 TO NOWHERE,
 OR TO THE
 LEGACY
 OF A FELISTER! 
IN LA POINTE
 THERE
 WAS
 UTTER
 DARKNESS,
 WHICH
 HAD
 LAYERED
 ITSELF
 SO THICKLY
 THAT
 THERE
 MUST
 HAVE
 BEEN
 NO EMPTY
 SPACE
 LEFT
 BETWEEN
 THE
 MOLECULES
 - AS IF SOMETHING
 WANTED
 TO EXIST
 BY ITSELF
 IN ALL
 THAT
 DARKNESS,
 RESEMBLING
 A KIND
 OF STATIC
 SMOKE. 
IN MY DREAM
 SOMETHING
 MADE
 ME ASK
 MYSELF
 WHAT
 DID
 I REALLY
 KNOW
 ABOUT
 MY COMPANIONS?
 ZONARA
 WAS
 A SKILLED
 NECROMANCER
 REPRESENTING
 THE
 DRUG CARTELS
 AND
 ... ARLO,
 A HIPSTER
 SELLING
 WEED
 FOR A LIVING,
 LIVING
 IN HIS
 OWN
 SICK
 AND
 DEGENERATE
 REALITY
 CREATED
 BY THE
 MAGIC
 SMOKE
 OF HIS
 DUTCH
 PRODUCT
 AND
 ... THEN? 
SO I HAD
 NO IDEA
 WHO
 THEY
 WERE
 OR WHAT
 THEIR
 INTENTIONS
 WERE!
 THEY
 COULD
 HAVE
 KILLED
 ME EVEN WHILE
 I SLEPT,
 AND
 THE
 ROCKERS
 COULD
 HAVE
 SLIT
 MY THROAT
 AND
 EVEN MOCKED
 MY CORPSE
 - AFTER
 ALL,
 I REMEMBERED
 THE
 END
 OF THE
 DURIGHT
 THAT
 HAD
 USED
 THE
 "POWER"
 HE HAD
 GOTTEN
 FROM
 GAS
 BENZOUR. 

IN MY DREAM
 I SAW
 AN ENDLESS
 FIELD
 COVERED
 WITH
 GREEN
 GRASS,
 AND
 THERE
 IN THE
 DISTANCE
 WERE
 CORN
 CROPS
 - THEY
 WERE
 SWAYING
 IN THE
 WIND.
 IT WAS
 HERE
 THAT
 OUR
 JOURNEY
 WITH
 GUS
 BEGAN. 
I RETURNED
 TO THE
 CEMETERY
 AGAIN
 - THE
 DREAM
 TRAP
 HUNG AROUND
 MY NECK
 - EVEN IN THIS
 DREAM.
 IT WAS
 MAGICAL,
 BUT
 ALSO
 SCARY.
 IT WAS
 LIKE
 AN EMISSARY
 OF SOME
 DISTANT
 KINGDOM
 - OR PERHAPS
 197 
 HE HAD
 CREATED
 THE
 INVISIBLE
 WALL
 THAT
 HAD
 STOPPED
 ME ON MY ASTRAL
 JOURNEY
 WHEN
 I WAS
 FORCED,
 ALONG
 WITH
 ZONAR
 AND
 ARLO,
 TO GET
 AWAY
 BECAUSE 

WHEN
 YOU'RE
 ON TOP OF THE
 WALL
 IT SEEMS SCARY,
 BUT WOULD
 YOU
 HAVE
 THE
 COURAGE
 TO JUMP?
 IT WAS
 LIKE
 GUS
 WAS
 MAKING
 ME DO JUST
 THAT!
 TO JUMP,
 AND
 MY PLUMMET
 WOULD
 BE ENDLESS.
 BUT
 WHERE
 WOULD
 I END
 UP?
 OR WAS
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 GOING
 ON A PILGRIMAGE!
 HIS
 PATH
 SEEMED
 INDESCRIBABLY
 LONG,
 AND
 HE HAD
 HARDLY
 GONE
 MORE
 THAN
 TEN
 OR FIFTEEN
 YARDS.
 WHAT
 WAS
 HAPPENING!
 AGAIN
 I BEGAN
 TO FEEL
 THE
 UNSEEN
 PRESENCE. 
FELISTER
 HAD
 ALSO
 THE
 FIVE
 PARTS
 OF THE
 BOOK
 OF SOLOMON-THE
 SO-CALLED
 PENTATEUCH-AND
 HAD
 DEVOTED
 HOURS
 OF HIS
 TIME
 TO STUDYING
 EVERY
 LINE
 AND
 EVERY
 WORD,
 PUTTING
 A PECULIAR
 MEANING
 INTO
 WHAT
 HE READ.
 THIS
 WAS
 NOT
 SOME
 HOBBY
 OR PLEASURABLE
 PASTIME
 FOR
 HIM,
 BUT
 A DESPERATE
 SEARCH
 FOR THE
 ANSWER
 AS HIS
 TIME
 ON THIS
 EARTH
 WAS
 RUNNING
 OUT.
 DEVIL
 OR ANGEL,
 THE
 MERE
 PRESENCE
 OF GUS
 BENZOUR
 HAD
 LEFT
 AN INDELIBLE
 MARK
 ON MY LIFE,
 AND
 I KNEW
 HE WOULD
 BRING
 ME AT LEAST
 ONE
 STEP
 CLOSER
 TO THE
 TRUTH.
 HOW
 I LONGED
 TO SPEAK
 TO HIM,
 BUT
 BLUEBIRD
 WAS
 ADAMANT
 THAT
 I HAD
 TO BEWARE
 OF THE
 OTHERS-PERHAPS
 HE MEANT
 ALL
 OF THEM.
 ONE
 OF THE
 GREAT
 SECRETS
 OF TRUE
 MAGIC
 WAS
 THAT
 WHEN
 IT OCCURRED,
 A TREMENDOUS
 AMOUNT
 OF ENERGY
 WAS
 RELEASED
 THAT
 WAS
 POORLY
 UNDERSTOOD,
 AND
 THIS
 WAS
 TRUE
 OF TRUE
 MAGIC
 - THIS
 ENERGY
 HAD
 THE
 ABILITY
 TO KILL,
 AND
 THE
 PRINCIPLE
 WAS
 LIKE
 A CHAIN
 REACTION
 - THE
 SOULS
 SUBDUED
 WERE
 DOOMED.
 TO THE
 UNINITIATED
 IT MIGHT
 HAVE
 SEEMED
 AMUSING,
 BUT
 I WAS
 BECOMING
 INCREASINGLY
 CONVINCED
 THAT
 THE
 HUGE
 NUMBER
 OF DEATHS
 ALONG
 THE
 ROUTE
 I WAS
 TRAVERSING
 WAS
 NO ACCIDENT
 AT ALL
 - I INITIALLY
 SUSPECTED
 THE
 DRUG CARTELS,
 THE
 POLICE,
 SOME
 SPOILED
 YUPPIES
 198 
 AND
 OTHER
 ADMINISTRATIVE
 DERELICTS
 WHO
 HADN'T
 EVEN SMELLED
 LIFE,
 THEN
 THE
 VARIOUS
 BANDITS
 OR ROCKERS
 WHO
 WERE
 ON OUR
 HEELS,
 THE
 INDIANS,
 MY OWN
 COMPANIONS
 - YES, THE
 CIRCLE
 WAS
 GRADUALLY
 CLOSING
 AND
 GETTING
 SMALLER
 AND
 SMALLER.
 UNTIL
 FINALLY... 

STRAKE! 

GUS
 BENZOUR
 TURNED
 ON HIS
 FLASHLIGHT
 - IT WAS
 DEFINITELY
 VERY
 POWERFUL,
 BUT
 WHO
 KNOWS
 WHY
 THE
 SURROUNDING
 DARKNESS
 SEEMED TO ABSORB
 THE
 LIGHT
 AND
 PREVENT
 IT FROM
 SPREADING. 
GUS
 STARTED
 WHISPERING
 SOME
 INARTICULATE
 WORDS.
 THEY
 WERE
 SO PECULIAR
 - HE COULDN'T
 SEEM TO PRONOUNCE
 THE
 WORDS
 PROPERLY,
 OR HE WAS
 JUST
 SPEAKING
 IN SOME
 CORRUPTED
 LANGUAGE
 OR ONE
 THAT
 DIDN'T
 EXIST
 AND
 WAS
 MADE
 UP BY HIM.
 HE REPEATED
 THE
 WORDS
 WITH
 GREAT
 EARNESTNESS,
 AND
 HIS
 FACE
 FOR THE
 FIRST
 TIME
 WAS
 TERRIBLY
 CONCERNED,
 EVEN AS IF SOME
 SUBTLE
 WRINKLES
 HAD
 APPEARED
 ON IT.
 IT WAS
 SO UNCHARACTERISTIC.
 HIS
 FLASHLIGHT
 WAS
 OF A RATHER
 HIGH
 QUALITY,
 BUT
 THE
 DARKNESS
 ALL
 AROUND
 THREATENED
 TO ENGULF
 HIM.
 THERE
 WAS
 A SOFT
 WARMTH
 AND
 A PECULIAR
 SMELL
 OF INCENSE
 - PERHAPS
 UNCLEAN
 FORCES
 OR FALLEN
 SOULS
 LURKED
 ABOUT.
 THEN
 I REALIZED
 SOMETHING
 - THE
 BRAVE
 GHAST,
 THE
 UNPLUCKY
 GHAST
 HAD NOT
 UTTERED
 SOME
 INCANTATION,
 NOR
 HAD
 HE TRIED
 TO SUMMON
 ANYONE'S
 SPIRIT
 - HE WAS
 PRAYING
 FOR HIS
 DOOMED
 SOUL.
 A SOUL
 THAT
 WOULD
 NOT
 NECESSARILY
 BE LOST,
 BUT
 WOULD
 BE BETWEEN
 HEAVEN
 AND
 EARTH
 FOR
 ALL
 TIME.
 THIS
 PUZZLED
 ME GREATLY,
 SINCE
 LA POINTE
 HAD
 BOTH
 A CHRISTIAN
 AND
 AN INDIAN
 PART,
 IF WE COULD
 TALK
 AT ALL
 ABOUT
 ANY
 ARRANGEMENT
 OF A PLACE
 LIKE
 THIS. 
- WHEN
 YOU'RE
 LOCKED
 IN A SILO
 ALL
 YOUR
 LIFE,
 YOU
 CAN'T
 SEE THE WORLD
 OUTSIDE.
 AND
 IT'S
 NOT
 199 
 FRIENDLY,
 AND
 IT MIGHT
 NOT
 EVEN BE THERE
 TOMORROW. 

I THOUGHT
 GUS
 WASN'T
 WITH
 EVERYONE.
 HIS
 PICKUP
 TRUCK
 WAS
 NOWHERE
 TO BE SEEN. 
GUS'S
 PICKUP
 WAS
 A FORD
 BRAND, IT WAS
 BLUE
 AND
 BIG
 IN A TYPICAL
 AMERICAN
 WAY,
 WITH
 A HUGE
 LONG
 OPEN
 TRUNK,
 AND
 ITS
 TIRES
 WERE
 4X4
 - CAPABLE
 OF GOING
 THROUGH
 ANYTHING.
 WITH
 IT,
 GUS
 USUALLY
 DROVE
 HIS
 FARM
 PRODUCE,
 OR SOMETIMES
 EVEN TRADED
 IN FERTILIZER,
 WHICH
 WAS
 IN DEMAND
 BY SOME
 SMALLER
 FARMS
 WHOSE
 OWNERS
 COULDN'T
 AFFORD
 TO TRAVEL
 TOO
 FAR.
 THEY
 USUALLY
 HAD VERY
 SMALL
 GARDENS
 - JUST
 ENOUGH
 TO FEED
 THEMSELVES
 AND
 PUT
 SOMETHING
 ON THEIR
 TABLE.
 AND
 GASS
 GENEROUSLY
 SUPPLIED
 IT TO THEM
 AT LOWER
 PRICES.
 I WONDERED
 WHERE
 THE
 CAR
 WAS?
 AND
 IF GUS
 WAS
 WALKING
 AMONG
 THE
 GRAVES
 TO DO SOMETHING
 THAT
 WAS
 OBVIOUSLY
 OF A VITAL
 NATURE,
 WHY
 HADN'T
 HE BROUGHT
 AT LEAST
 ONE
 STRAIGHT
 SHOVEL?
 THE
 USE
 OF SUCH
 A TOOL
 WAS
 PERFECTLY
 NATURAL,
 FOR
 OTHERWISE
 HE WOULD
 HAVE
 HAD
 TO KICK
 WITH
 HIS
 CLAWS
 LIKE
 SOME
 EVIL
 SPIRIT
 WHO
 WANTED
 TO GET
 AT THE
 CORPSE
 OF THE
 DEAD
 - BY THE
 WAY,
 THE
 EVIL SPIRITS
 OR DJINN,
 WHICH
 WERE
 SOMETIMES
 USED
 EVEN BY THE
 FELISTER
 HIMSELF,
 HAD
 A DIFFERENT
 LEVEL
 OF SPIRITUAL
 ENERGY
 THAT
 HELPED
 THEM
 TO REMAIN
 IN THE
 REALM
 OF THE
 LIVING,
 AND
 BORE
 ALL
 SORTS
 OF NAMES
 - HADALI,
 JAIKINS,
 MANTRICS
28, AND
 SO ON.
 THE
 LATTER,
 OF COURSE,
 WERE
 THE
 TOP OF THE
 HIERARCHY
 OF SPIRITS
 AND
 WERE
 ABLE
 TO KILL
 WITH
 EASE.
 THEIR
 ABILITY
 TO GENERATE
 BLACK
 ENERGY
 WAS
 PROVERBIAL.
 BUT
 GUS
 DID
 NOT
 SUMMON
 DEMONS,
 HE DID
 NOT
 CALL
 EVIL
 SPIRITS,
 HE DID
 NOT
 WANT
 TO                                                
 28 Names of various beings inhabiting the thin invisib
le world 
and carrying negative energy. 
200 
 COMMUNICATE
 WITH
 THE
 DEAD,
 HE JUST
 STOOD
 THERE
 - AS IF HE HAD
 COMPLETELY
 LOST
 HOPE. 
"HOPE
 DIES
 LAST!,"
 THOUGHT
 I. HE TURNED
 SUDDENLY
 - AS IF HE HAD
 DETECTED
 MY VOICE
 COMING
 AS IF FROM
 UNDER
 WATER.
 BUT
 THEN
 I REALIZED
 IT WAS
 JUST
 SOME
 UNNATURAL
 MOVEMENT
 HE WAS
 APPARENTLY
 PERFORMING
 TO BE IN TUNE
 WITH
 THE
 REALITY
 AROUND
 HIM.
 COULD
 IT BE THAT
 GUS
 WANTED
 TO BE INVISIBLE?
 SO,
 EVERY
 WIZARD
 AND
 EVEN CONVENTIONAL
 SCIENTIST
 KNEW
 THAT
 COMPLETE
 INVISIBILITY
 WAS
 NOT
 POSSIBLE
 AND
 WAS
 A PRODUCT
 OF INSUFFICIENT
 KNOWLEDGE
 OF MAGICAL
 SCIENCE.
 HADN'T
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 SIMPLY
 LOST
 HIS
 MIND
 AND
 WASTED
 HIS
 TIME
 SEARCHING
 FOR SOMETHING
 THAT
 SIMPLY
 DIDN'T
 EXIST? 
JUST
 THEN,
 I FELT
 THE
 FAMILIAR
 SOFT
 WARMTH
 AND
 DISTINCT
 SENSE
 OF PRESENCE,
 AND
 GUS'S
 FLASHLIGHT
 ILLUMINATED
 A TOMBSTONE
 - IT TOOK
 ME A MOMENT
 TO RECOGNIZE
 THE
 NAME
 ON IT. THE
 FONT
 WAS
 SLIGHTLY
 GOTHIC
 AND
 SPECKLED
 WITH
 SOME
 ORNAMENTATION,
 BUT ... IT WAS
 MY NAME
 - ELIZANDER
 BARNAYNE. 
DAMN
 IT,
 GAS
 BENZOOR!
 WHAT
 WAS
 THAT
 BASTARD
 DOING?
 DIRTY
 SON
 OF A BITCH!
 GODDAMN
 FARMER!
 TRAITOR! 

GUS
 BENZOUR
 STOOD
 LIKE
 THAT
 FOR
 A WHILE
 AND WENT
 SOMEWHERE.
 LIKE
 I SAID,
 HIS
 PICKUP
 WAS
 ABSOLUTELY
 NOWHERE
 TO BE SEEN,
 AND
 IT WAS
 IMPOSSIBLE
 THAT
 HE'D
 COME
 HERE
 JUST
 LIKE
 THAT
 - SOMETHING
 HAD
 TO HAVE
 BROUGHT
 HIM
 HERE.
 HE RETURNED
 A FEW
 MINUTES
 LATER,
 AND
 THIS
 TIME
 THE
 CHERISHED
 SHOVEL
 WAS
 IN HIS
 HANDS,
 AND
 HE SET
 TO DIGGING.
 HE WAS
 DOING
 IT WITH
 HIS
 EYES CLOSED,
 MUMBLING
 SOME
 UNINTELLIGIBLE
 MANTRA,
 AND
 EVEN HIS
 LIPS
 WEREN'T
 MOVING
 - I WAS
 CLEARLY
 AWARE
 THAT
 HE WAS
 OBVIOUSLY
 TRYING
 TO STRENGTHEN
 HIS
 201 
 ENERGY
 FIELD
 OR ELSE
 REACH
 HIS
 TARGET.
 THE
 GROUND
 WAS
 LOOSE,
 AND
 THE
 SHOVEL
 WAS
 REACHING
 DEEPER
 AND
 DEEPER.
 I DIDN'T
 KNOW
 HOW
 DEEP
 THEY
 DUG THEM
 GRAVES
 IN WISCONSIN,
 BUT
 ...
 SUDDENLY
 THERE
 WAS
 THE
 SOUND
 OF A THUD
 - THE
 SHOVEL
 MUST
 HAVE
 HIT
 A TREE. 
IT REVEALED
 A COFFIN
 OF SOLID
 MAHOGANY
 THAT
 LOOKED
 IMPRESSIVE
 - ALMOST
 LIKE
 NEW.
 BUT
 AFTER
 LOOKING
 CLOSELY,
 I NOTICED
 THAT
 IT WAS
 ACTUALLY
 QUITE
 WEATHERED
 AND
 EVEN SOME
 OF ITS
 HANDLES
 MUST
 HAVE
 FALLEN
 OFF.
 WHAT
 WAS
 HIDING
 INSIDE? 
FOR SOME
 INEXPLICABLE
 REASON
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 WAS
 IN NO HURRY
 TO OPEN
 IT.
 HE WAITED
 A WHILE.
 THEN
 HE SET
 TO WORK
 CLEARING
 AWAY
 THE
 DIRT
 AND
 ATTEMPTED
 TO USE
 THE
 SHOVEL
 AS A LEVER
 TO FACILITATE
 HIS
 EFFORTS. 
FINALLY,
 THE
 LID GAVE
 WAY
 AND THERE
 WAS
 NOTHING
 INSIDE
 THE
 COFFIN.
 I LOOKED...
 IT WASN'T
 POSSIBLE
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 WAS
 ANYTHING
 BUT
 A FOOL.
 HE WASN'T
 GOING
 TO MAKE
 THAT
 MUCH
 EFFORT,
 AND
 AT NIGHT,
 AT THE
 RISK
 OF EVEN BEING
 CAUGHT,
 TO OPEN
 AN EMPTY
 COFFIN.
 THERE
 HAD
 TO BE SOMETHING-EVEN
 IF I COULDN'T
 SEE
 WHAT
 IT WAS. 
GUS
 WAS
 ONCE
 AGAIN
 LEFT
 STARING
 INTO
 NOTHINGNESS.
 THEN
 HE HELD
 OUT
 HIS
 HAND.
 INSIDE,
 IN PERFECTLY
 PRESERVED
 CONDITION,
 WAS
 ABRAMELIN'S
 GRIMOIRE. 
GUS
 BENZOIR
 GRINNED
 A FRIGHTENING
 SMILE,
 BUT IT WAS
 OBVIOUS
 THAT
 IT DID
 NOT
 BETRAY
 THE
 SPIRITUAL
 SUPERIORITY
 HE HAD
 POSSESSED
 IN HIS
 ENCOUNTER
 WITH
 DURAITH.
 SOMETHI
NG DIDN'T
 ADD
 UP. 
MOISTURE
 IN THE
 SOIL
 COULD
 EASILY
 DAMAGE
 THE
 BOOK
 - UNLESS... 
MAYBE
 IT WAS
 PUT
 THERE
 RECENTLY...
 BUT
 BY WHOM? 
202 
 - "IT WILL
 ALL
 FALL
 INTO
 PLACE
 SOON,"
 GAS
 BENZOUR
 STATED,
 EYES CLOSED,
 "THIS
 CYCLE
 HAD
 TO BE BROKEN
 ONCE
 AND
 FOR ALL." 
AT THAT
 TIME,
 I FELT
 SOME
 COOL
 BREEZE.
 DID
 I DREAM?
 NO THE
 COOL
 BLADE
 WAS
 AT MY THROAT.
 IT TOOK
 ME A WHILE
 TO REALIZE
 WHAT
 WAS
 HAPPENING... 
MAYBE
 THAT
 BLADE
 AROUND
 MY NECK
 WAS
 TOTALLY
 REAL
 AND
 IN THAT
 LINE
 OF THOUGHT
 SOMEONE
 WAS
 TRYING
 TO CLEANSE
 ME. BUT WHO
 KNOWS
 WHY
 I WANTED
 TO STAY
 WHERE
 I WAS.
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 HESITATED,
 BUT
 EVENTUALLY
 DECIDED
 TO OPEN
 UP. 
IT OCCURRED
 TO ME THAT
 MACHIAVELLI
 WAS
 RIGHT,
 AND
 GUS
 BENZOIR
 WAS
 A FINE
 EXAMPLE
 OF THAT. 
THE
 GRIMOIRE
 SLOWLY
 DISSOLVED
 AND
 I FELT
 MY HAIR
 STAND
 ON END.
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 JUST
 CHECKED
 SOMETHING
 QUICKLY
 AND
 CLOSED
 IT,
 THEN
 SET
 TO WORK
 PAINSTAKINGLY
 BURYING
 THE
 GRAVE.
 IT WOULD
 BE COMICAL
 IF THE
 SITUATION
 WASN'T
 SO SERIOUS.
 THE
 SHOVEL
 WAS
 THROWING
 THE
 DIRT
 BACK
 AND
 BURYING
 THE
 TRUTH... 
BUT NOW
 I COULD
 FEEL
 THE
 ANNOYING
 BLADE
 THAT
 WAS
 PROBABLY
 ALREADY
 CUTTING
 MY THROAT,
 OR WOULD
 SOON
 DO SO.
 I DECIDED
 TO DO SOMETHING
 UNHEARD
 OF, IF I HAD
 TO HIDE
 FROM
 EVERYONE
 AND
 BE INCONSPICUOUS,
 WASN'T
 IT SMARTER
 TO STAY
 IN THIS
 PLACE...
 JUST
 A LITTLE
 LONGER... 
THEN
 I REALIZED
 SOMETHING
 INTERESTING...
 IF THE
 BLADE
 THAT
 WAS
 SUPPOSED
 TO KILL
 ME WAS
 AIMED
 THAT
 WAY,
 IT WAS
 POSSIBLE
 THAT
 IT WAS
 A BALANCED
 WEIGHT
 - THEN
 THE
 SLIGHTEST
 RESISTANCE
 ON MY PART
 WOULD
 BE FATAL.
 SUCH
 STEALTH
 KNIVES
 EXISTED,
 MADE
 IN THE
 USA,
 AND
 WERE
 USED
 IN MILITARY
 CONFLIC
TS AROUND
 THE
 WORLD,
 BUT IN 203 
 PRACTICE
 COULD
 BE BOUGHT
 IN CERTAIN
 PLACES.
 ZONARA
 HAD
 ALREADY
 DEALT
 WITH
 JAKE,
 OR AT LEAST
 I ASSUMED
 THAT
 THEORY,
 WHY
 NOT
 KILL
 ME IN MY SLEEP
 TOO?
 HOW
 FAR
 COULD
 THIS
 WOMAN'S
 UNSCRUPULOUSNESS
 GO? 
THEN
 I THOUGHT
 OF SOMETHING
 INTERESTING,
 WHAT
 IF I USED
 MY OWN
 MIND
 AND CAUSED
 A BACKLASH
 AND
 TURNED
 THE
 KNIFE
 ON HER.
 IT SOUNDED
 STUPID
 AND
 NOT
 VERY
 PROFESSIONAL,
 BUT
 IT WAS
 VERY
 POSSIBLE
 IT WOULD
 WORK.
 THERE
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 BEEN
 SOMEONE
 ELSE
 IN THE
 DARK.
 YES, THE
 ROCKERS
 HAD
 TAKEN
 OVER
 THE
 ENTIRE
 MOTEL,
 BUT
 IT WAS
 FAR
 FROM
 JUST
 THAT.
 ZONER
 AND
 ARLO
 AND
 I WERE
 IN THE
 SAME
 ROOM
 ON THE
 SECOND
 FLOOR
 - SO IF ANYTHING
 WENT
 WRONG,
 SOME
 PRETTY
 TOUGH
 GUYS
 WOULD
 BE COMING
 AND
 I'D
 HAVE
 NO CHOICE
 BUT TO JUMP
 OUT
 THE
 WINDOW
 IF I DIDN'T
 GET
 SHOT
 FIRST. 
I WAS
 ABOUT
 TO MAKE
 WHAT
 I CALLED
 A "CONSCIOUS
 SWITCH"
 AND
 I HOPED
 THAT
 WOULD
 SAVE
 ME. I REMEMBERED
 THAT
 THE
 ANSWER
 WAS
 TO BE FOUND
 IN MY DREAM
 - THE
 WHISPERING
 OF THE
 WIND
 IN LA POINTE
 CEMETERY.
 THIS
 WAS
 THE
 KEY
 TO AWARENESS!
 THIS
 WAS
 SALVATION. 
I SAW
 THAT
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 HAD
 ALREADY
 FINISHED
 REBURYING
 THE
 GRAVE
 AND
 ... THEN
 I INSTANTLY
 USED
 THE
 WIND
 FROM
 MY ASTRAL
 JOURNEY
 - IT COULD
 SAVE
 ME.
 I FELT
 MOVEMENT
 IN MY SOLAR
 PLEXUS,
 MAYBE
 I HAD
 SUMMONED
 SOME
 DEMON
 OR MAYBE
 THAT
 INVISIBLE
 COMPANION
 WAS
 GOING
 TO HELP
 ME AND
 THEN
 I JUST
 OPENED
 MY EYES.
 THE
 KNIFE
 LIKE
 MORE
 MAGIC
 TURNED
 AND
 AT THE
 SLIGHTEST
 PRESSURE
 ON MY PART
 STUCK
 ITSELF
 IN THE
 NECK
 OF ... GUS
 BENZOUR! 
IT WAS
 IMPOSSIBLE. 
204 
 BEFORE
 HE GASPED,
 I MANAGED
 TO READ
 HIS
 MIND.
 "I USED
 THE
 SHADOWS
 TO GET
 TO YOU,
 ELIZANDER,
 YOU'VE
 LEARNED
 TOO
 MUCH,
 AND
 YOU
 MAY
 SOON
 DEFEAT
 THE
 GREAT
 DESIGN!
 AND
 THAT
 IS INTOLERABLE.
 WHERE
 YOU
 THOUGHT
 YOU
 WERE
 GOING-EVEN
 IF YOU
 GET
 THERE,
 YOU'LL
 FIND
 YOUR
 PATH
 LEADS
 NOWHERE!" 
HIS
 BLOOD
 STAINED
 ME AND
 I LOOKED
 LIKE
 A SACRIFICIAL
 LAMB
 IN SOME
 LOW-GRADE
 HORROR
 MOVIE.
 I KNEW
 THAT
 THE
 REAL
 INCANTATIONS
 FROM
 ABRAMELIN'S
 BOOK
 INCLUDED
 VARIOUS
 TECHNIQUES
 FOR TRANSFORMING
 AND
 BECOMING
 AN ANIMAL
 AND
 SO ON,
 BUT
 SIMILAR
 IDEAS
 WERE
 FOUND
 IN THE
 TEACHINGS
 OF DON
 JUAN
 CASTANEDA.
 FOR REAL
 MAGIC,
 SOMETHING
 MUCH
 MORE
 WAS
 NEEDED...
 FAITH
 WAS
 NEEDED,
 AND
 THIS
 FAITH
 WAS CONNECTED
 WITH
 SURVIVAL
 AND
 WITH
 LIFE
 ITSELF!
 FAITH
 WAS
 NOT
 TAUGHT
 - YOU
 EITHER
 HAD
 IT OR YOU
 DIDN'T...
 WITHOUT
 IT,
 EVEN
 ABRAMELIN'S
 GRIMOIRE
 WAS
 JUST
 A PILE
 OF USELESS
 PAGES,
 ALTHOUGH
 IN MEDIEVAL
 TIMES,
 WHEN
 THE
 BOOK
 WAS
 WRITTEN,
 ANIMAL
 SKINS
 WERE
 USED
 FOR THE
 PAGES,
 WHICH
 USUALLY
 MADE
 THEM
 INCREDIBLY
 HEAVY
 AND
 REQUIRED
 SEVERAL
 MEN TO CARRY
 THEM. 
GUS
 BENZOUR
 JUST
 COLLAPSED
 TO THE
 GROUND
 WITH
 A DULL
 THUD,
 BUT
 MAYBE
 HE'D
 CREATED
 A SPECIAL
 CURSE
 TO CATCH
 UP WITH
 ME LATER.
 I WONDERED
 IF HE HAD
 EVER BEEN
 A FARMER!
 THIS
 BRUTAL
 TYPE
 AND
 FREAK! 

THEN
 I SAW
 THE
 IMAGE
 OF AN ANGEL
 - HE WAS
 COVERED
 IN BLOOD.
 AND
 HE HAD
 TEARS
 IN HIS
 EYES.
 MAYBE
 THERE
 WAS
 SALVATION
 AFTER
 ALL...
 OR MAYBE
 I WAS
 JUST
 GOING
 TO BE ESCORTED
 BY A SO-CALLED
 GUARDIAN
 ANGEL
 TO MY VERY
 END
 BEFORE
 I WAS
 FINALLY
 SENT
 WHERE
 I NEEDED
 TO GO. 
205 
 ZONARA
 AND
 ARLO
 SLEPT
 FITFULLY.
 I DECIDED
 TO GET
 UP,
 BUT
 IT WAS
 LIKE
 I WAS
 NUMB.
 SOMETHING
 WAS
 DEFINITELY
 WRONG
 HERE! 
I KNEW
 THAT
 THE
 ANGEL
 OF DEATH
 WAS
 COMING
 FOR EVERYONE
 - FOR
 SOME
 HE WAS
 AN ANGEL,
 FOR
 OTHERS
 A DEMON,
 AND
 THAT
 GENERALLY
 DEPENDED
 ON HOW
 RIGHTEOUS
 HIS
 SOUL
 WAS.
 EVEN THE
 ALMIGHTY
 GAVE
 THE
 RIGHT
 OF REPENTANCE
 AND
 THE
 EVENTUAL
 POSSIBILITY
 OF SALVATION
 TO THE
 REPENTANT. 
THEN
 I WONDERED
 HOW
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 HAD
 PASSED
 THROUGH
 THE
 SLEEPERS
 BELOW
 WITHOUT
 EVER BEING
 SEEN OR FELT.
 IT WAS
 POINTLESS
 TO ASK
 FOR SECURITY
 CAMERA
 FOOTAGE
 - FIRSTLY
 I HAD
 NO RIGHT
 TO DO SO AND
 SECONDLY
 I WOULD
 HAVE
 AROUSED
 HUGE
 SUSPICIONS
 EVEN
 IF I HAD
 FABRICATED
 SOME
 TAIL
 LIE. 
GUS'S
 EYES
 WERE
 THE
 SAME
 AS A BLUEBIRD'S
 - THEY
 SEEMED TO BE MISSING
 AND
 I FOUND
 THAT
 NOT
 SO MUCH
 FRIGHTENING
 AS SAD.
 SO GUS
 WAS
 JUST
 ANOTHER
 FALLEN
 SOUL
 WHO
 ... I TURNED
 AROUND
 - ARLO
 AND
 ZONARA
 WERE
 STILL
 SLEEPING
 FITFULLY,
 BUT
 THE
 INTUITION
 MY ASTRAL
 TRAVEL
 HAD
 DEVELOPED
 TOLD
 ME THAT
 SOMETHING
 WAS
 NOT
 RIGHT,
 TO SAY THE
 LEAST.
 GUS
 HAD
 A HOLE
 IN HIS
 HEAD,
 AS STEALTH
 KNIVES
 REQUIRED
 MINIMAL
 PRESSURE.
 I THANKED
 THE
 SICK
 BRAIN
 THAT
 HAD
 INVENTED
 THEM,
 THEY
 HAD
 ALSO
 COME
 INTO
 USE
 IN THE
 WAR
 IN CHECHNYA
 - AND
 WITH
 PARTICULAR
 SUCCESS.
 AND
 NOW
 THE
 SAME
 TYPE
 OF KNIFE
 HAD
 SAV
ED MY LIFE. 
WHAT
 WAS
 HAPPENING
 TO ZONARA
 AND
 THE
 ARLO?
 WHERE
 WOULD
 THEIR
 SOULS
 GO?
 WE WERE
 TEMPORARY
 VISITORS
 ON THIS
 EARTH
 - SOONER
 OR LATER,
 THE
 PATHS
 OF US ALL
 PART. 
ZONARA
 SHUDDERED.
 BUT APPARENTLY
 SOME
 FORCE
 WAS
 PREVENTING
 HER
 FROM
 WAKING.
 SOMETHING
 206 
 TERRIBLE
 HELD
 HER
 IN ITS
 CLUTCHES,
 AND
 SHE
 FELT
 SOME
 STRANGE
 MIXTURE
 OF EMOTIONS.
 AND
 WAS
 ARLO
 ALIVE? 
I'VE
 HEARD
 THAT
 SOME
 PEOPLE
 HAVE
 SEEN SO-CALLED
 RED
 EYES IN THEIR
 SLEEP.
 MANY
 CONSIDER
 THIS
 A HOAX,
 BUT I TOO
 HAD
 SEEN THEM,
 AND
 I SUSPECT
 THE
 LATE
 FELISTER
 DID
 AS WELL. 
THE
 NIGHT
 SEEMED
 ENDLESS
 - I LOOKED
 AT THE
 CLOCK.
 EXACTLY
 3:15.
 WHETHER
 WHOEVER
 HAD
 ATTACKED
 ME WAS
 THE
 REAL
 GUS.
 I LOOKED
 AROUND
 THE
 ROOM
 CAREFULLY.
 THERE
 WAS
 NO CORPSE,
 BUT
 THE
 KNIFE
 IN MY HAND
 WAS
 REAL.
 WHERE
 HAD
 IT COME
 FROM
 THEN.
 ZONARA
 HAD
 NO WEAPON
 OTHER
 THAN
 THE
 GUN,
 BUT I SUSPECTED
 THE
 ROCKERS
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 TAKEN
 IT FROM
 HER
 SO SHE
 WOULDN'T
 BE A THREAT
 TO THEM. 
BUT KNOWING
 ZONARA,
 SHE
 MUST
 HAVE
 PROVIDED
 SOME
 BACKUP.
 MAYBE
 SHE
 WAS
 HIDING
 SOME
 KIND
 OF POISON
 NEEDLE
 IN HER
 HAIR
 THAT
 WOULD
 STICK
 IN MY CAROTID
 ARTERY
 AND
 I'D
 JUST
 DIE.
 AND
 ARLO
 COULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 THE
 BIG
 WINNER.
 THAT
 CONFORMIST!
 WAS
 ALWAYS
 LIKE
 WATER-SPILLING
 OUT
 IN VARIOUS
 FORMS,
 AND
 THIS
 BROUGHT
 HIM
 MANY
 ADVANTAGES
 AND
 OPENED
 HIS
 WAY
 FORWARD. 
I REMEMBERED
 THAT
 BLUEBIRD
 HAD
 TOLD
 ME ONE
 OTHER
 THING
 AS OF LATE: 
- NO MATTER
 WHAT
 THE
 PATH
 BEFORE
 YOU,
 YOU
 MUST
 WALK
 IT IF YOU
 WANT
 TO... 
"HOW
 MANY
 LOST
 SOULS
 WILL
 YOU
 WOO
 ELIZANDER!
 HOW
 MANY
 LOST
 LIVES
 WILL
 REMAIN
 BETWEEN
 THE
 INDIFFERENT
 CONCRETE
 OF THESE
 BUILDINGS
 AND
 THESE
 STREETS?" 
THE CITY
 SLEPT
 QUIETLY!
 I HAD
 THE
 VAGUE
 FEELING
 THAT
 ALL
 THIS
 TERRITORY
 HAD
 LONG
 SINCE
 BEEN
 TAKEN
 OVER
 BY THOSE
 WHO
 SIMPLY
 HAD
 NOWHERE
 TO 207 
 GO-DOOMED
 SOULS!
 THEY
 CONTINUED
 TO SHOW
 NO SIGNS
 OF LIFE.
 MY GLOOMY
 THOUGHTS
 WERE
 INTERRUPTED
 - ZONARA
 YAWNED!
 IT WAS
 ALIVE
 AND BREATHING-
 MY LOVE
 AND
 MY CURSE!
 MY FRIEND! 
OUR
 EYES MET. 
- HERE,
 AT LAST,
 I SAW
 THE
 LARGER
 PART
 OF THE
 PICTURE.
 AND
 THAT
 IT DIDN'T
 KILL
 ME WAS
 PART
 OF THE
 ORDEAL.
 ONLY
 I CAN
 LEAD
 YOU
 TO THE
 REAL
 PLACE
 - WHERE
 THE
 RITUAL
 CAN
 BE PERFORMED,
 AND
 PERHA
PS OUR
 WISHES
 CAN
 BE GRANTED.
 IF IT WERE
 POSSIBLE
 TO WISH
 FOR ANYTHING,
 WHAT
 WOULD
 YOU
 WISH
 FOR? 
HER
 EYES LOOKED
 AT ME SLYLY
 - SHE
 WAS
 NEITHER
 AN ANGEL
 NOR
 A DEVIL.
 AND
 I DIDN'T
 KNOW
 WHAT
 SHE
 WAS.
 ARLO
 WAS
 STILL
 IN MORPHEUS'
 ARMS
29, SO I DECIDED
 TO USE
 THESE
 FEW
 MOMENTS
 TO CLEAR
 THINGS
 UP WITH
 ZONER
 ONCE
 AND
 FOR ALL. 
- I HAVE
 A FEELING
 THAT
 THE
 STRANGE
 ALIGNMENT
 OF EVENTS
 SO FAR
 IS NO COINCIDENCE
 AT ALL,"
 I ASKED
 HER
 THE
 QUESTION
 IN REVERSE,
 "AND
 I'M
 ALMOST
 CERTAIN
 THAT
 EITHER
 THIS
 INVISIBLE
 COMPANION
 OR YOURSELF
 HAD
 A HAND
 IN IT.
 ZONARA
 LOOKED
 UP AT ME WITH
 HER
 BEAUTIFUL
 GLASS
 EYES - EYES
 THAT
 SPELLED
 DEATH,
 OR AT THE
 VERY
 LEAST,
 LACK
 OF SALVATION. 
- IT IS NOT!
 BUT
 YOU
 HAD
 TO CROSS
 THE
 ROAD!
 IT'S
 THAT
 SIMPLE!
 GOOD
 OR BAD
 - IT'S
 YOUR
 PATH! 
- YOU
 ARE
 MINE
 ... - "YOUR
 REALITY
 DOESN'T
 EXIST
 ANYWHERE
 ELSE
 BUT
 HERE,"
 SHE
 TOUCHED
 A FINGER
 TO MY FOREHEAD,
 "IT
 WAS
 DECIDED
 AT ALMOST
 THE
 HIGHEST
 LEVEL,
 NO MATTER
 WHAT
 HAPPENS
 TO YOU,
 THAT
 I WILL
 BE YOUR
                                                
 29 Morpheus - god of sleep. 
208 
 OVERSEER
30 UNTIL
 THE
 VERY
 END.
 AND
 I WILL
 BE STRICT.
 I CAN
 ONLY
 TELL
 YOU
 NOT
 TO MISTAKE
 MY SERVICE
 FOR
 IDOLATRY
 - AND
 TO MAKE
 IT ABOUT
 WORK,
 NOT
 FEELINGS
 OR LOVE." 
- MMM... 
SHE
 PUT
 A FINGER
 TO MY LIPS
 TO STOP
 THERE. 
- "IF
 YOU
 REALLY
 ARE
 ... WHY
 ARE
 YOU
 LEADING
 ME DOWN
 THE
 PATH
 OF SIN
?," I ASKED
 HER,
 PUZZLED. 
- I ONLY
 ACCOMPANY
 YOU
 IN YOUR
 PATH
 BECAUSE
 YOU
 SHOULD
 NOT
 BE LEFT
 ALONE.
 THERE
 IS AT LEAST
 ONE
 OF US ATTACHED
 TO EACH
 OF YOU.
 I HAVE
 ASSUMED
 THIS
 FORM
 SO THAT
 YOU
 MAY
 PERCEIVE
 ME MORE
 EASILY
 AND
 HAVE
 SOMEONE
 TO "SHARE"
 YOUR
 SUFFERING. 

I LOOKED
 TO ARLO. 
- "IS HE GOING
 TO WAKE
 UP?," I ASKED
 HER
 AGAIN. 
- "IF YOU
 WANT
 TO?," WAS
 THE
 REPLY.
 "AFTER
 ALL,
 YOU
 DECIDE
 WHO
 YOU
 HAVE
 IN YOUR
 LIFE." 
- "WHO
 IS HE?," I ASKED
 AGAIN. 
- YOUR
 GUARDIAN
 ANGEL
 ... 
I LOOKED
 AT ARLO
 - IT WAS
 HARD
 TO BELIEVE
 THAT
 ANGELS
 LOOKED
 JUST
 LIKE
 HIM,
 BUT I KNEW
 THAT
 THEY
 COULD
 TAKE
 HUMAN
 FORM
 AND
 DO WHATEVER
 THEY
 WANTED
 - AS LONG
 AS THEY
 HELPED
 US SINNERS. 
I DECIDED
 TO SEE IF THE
 ROCKERS
 WERE
 DOWN
 THERE.
 YES, THE
 GANG
 WAS
 FAST
 ASLEEP,
 BUT
 THEY'D
                                                
 30 Author's Note - Usually angels appear in male form to 
humans, even though they are sexless beings of the spi
rit world, 
but in some passages of Holy Scripture, they can also app
ear 
as women, for example [Zechariah 5:9-
11] 209 
 PROBABLY
 ALL
 BE UP SOON
 - BEFORE
 THE
 CLOCK
 HAD
 STRUCK
 FOUR
 IN
 THE
 MORNING.
 THEY
 PREFERRED
 TO TRAVEL
 IN THE
 DARK
 - PARTLY
 TO AVOID
 THE
 HEAVIER
 TRAFFIC
 IN SOME
 PLACES,
 ALTHOUGH
 THE
 ROADS
 WERE
 UNUSUALLY
 DESERTED. 
ARLO
 WOKE
 UP.
 HE LOOKED
 AT ME AND
 FOR THE
 FIRST
 TIME
 I NOTICED
 HIS
 STRANGE
 EYES
 - THEY
 WERE
 INHUMAN. 

WE CONTINUED
 ON OUR
 WAY
 TO LA POINTE,
 BUT
 SOMETHING
 WAS
 GIVING
 ME NO PEACE.
 I REALIZED
 I HAD
 MY ANGELS
 WHO
 WOULD
 BE MY COMPANIONS
 AND
 WATCH
 OVER
 ME,
 BUT
 THERE
 WAS
 NO REASONABLE
 EXPLANATION
 REGARDING
 GUS
 BENZOUR.
 WHO
 WAS
 HE? 

- 'THERE
 IS ONE
 WAY
 TO FIND
 OUT
 EVERYTHING,'
 ZONARA
 WHISPERED
 TO ME IN AN INHUMAN
 VOICE,
 'BUT
 YOU
 HAVE
 TO THINK
 OF IT YOURSELF. 
LITTLE
 BY LITTLE
 I BEGAN
 TO REALIZE
 - GUS
 WAS
 A HIGH
 MAGE
 MANTRIC
 WHO
 HAD
 TO ACHIEVE
 SOMETHING
 - SOMETHING
 BIG
 AND
 KILL
 THE
 OTHERS.
 WHY
 ELSE
 WERE
 HIS
 SILENT
 MANTRAS
 AND
 STRANGELY
 WORRIED
 EXPRESSION?
 WHY
 WAS
 HE COMPLETELY
 ALONE?
 AND
 WHY
 DID
 NO ONE
 KNOW
 ANYTHING
 ABOUT
 HIM? 
I SECRETLY
 DECIDED
 TO DO SOMETHING
 UNHEARD
 OF - TO
 CHECK
 IN THE
 POLICE
 ARCHIVES
 IF SUCH
 A MAN
 EVEN EXISTED. 
BUT THE
 PROBLEM
 WAS
 THAT
 THE
 OFFICE
 HOURS
 WERE
 STARTING... 

I COULD
 HAVE
 DONE
 IT LATER
 AND
 THE
 RESULTS
 WERE
 NOT
 LATE.

 CHAPTER
 EIGHTEEN:
 LA POINTE
 CEMETERY 
 
THE
 STURDY
 MEN
 WOKE
 UP AND
 HAD
 A DECENT
 AMERICAN
 BREAKFAST,
 WHICH
 CONSISTED
 OF BACON
 AND
 EGGS
 AND
 WHOLE
 WHEAT
 BREAD.
 THEY
 ALSO
 TURNED
 OVER
 A DECENT
 AMOUNT
 OF BEER.
 AND
 JUMPED
 ON THE
 BIKES
 - WE HAD
 TO FOLLOW
 THEM
 FOR THE
 SIMPLE
 REASON
 THAT
 I COULDN'T
 TELL
 THEM
 ABOUT
 THE
 LITTLE
 NIGHT
 INCIDENT,
 OR MY FIGHT
 WITH
 GUS. 

"THEN
 GASS
 WAS
 A MIGHTY
 MANTRIC!
31 " THOUGHT
 I. "THAT'S
 WHY
 EVEN BLUEBIRD
 HAD
 A FEAR
 OF HIM.
 HIS
 SPIRITUAL
 POWERS
 MUST
 HAVE
 BEEN
 IMMENSE!" 
AS WE DROVE
 PAST
 THE
 TOWN,
 OR RATHER
 LITERALLY
 FLEW
 PAST
 IT,
 I COULD
 FEEL
 THE
 NOSTALGIA
 OF THOSE
 WIDE
 STREETS
 THAT
 SEEMED
 TO BE A SYMBOL
 OF FREEDOM.
 SOME
 OF THE
 BUILDINGS
 WERE
 IN BEAUTIFUL
 VICTORIAN
 STYLE
 AND
 WERE
 DESIGNED
 FOR HOLIDAY
 LETS. 
I FELT
 THE
 WIND
 IN MY EARS
 AGAIN.
 AND
 THE
 SAME
 RELATIVELY
 UNIFORM
 LANDSCAPES
 BEGAN
 TO CHANGE
 AROUND
 ME. SOMEWHERE
 TOWARDS
 ASHLAND
 CITY
 WE CROSSED
 ONE
 OF THOSE
 STRANGE
 BRIDGES
 WITH
 RUSTY
 IRONWORK.
 OUR
 WHOLE
 GROUP
 HAD
 ASSEMBLED
 AS INSTRUCTED
 BACK
 AT IRONWOOD,
 BUT OUR
 PASSAGE
 THROUGH
 ASHLAND
 CITY
 WAS
 NOT
 WITHOUT
 PROBLEMS.
 WE HAD
 TO REFUEL,
 AND
 SOME
 ARROGANT
 GUY
 WOULDN'T
 GIVE
 ANY
 TO EVERYONE,
 AND
 THEN
 HE JUST
 GOT BRUTALLY
 BEATEN.
 LUCKILY
 THERE
 WERE
 NO WITNESSES.
 TO GET
 TO MADELINE
 ISLAND,
 WE JUST
 HAD
 TO TAKE
 THE
 FERRY
 FROM
 THE
 BAYFIELD
 TERMINAL
 - OF COURSE
 THIS
 TOOK
 A WHILE,
 BUT NOBODY
 CARED. 
                                               
 31 Mantrics are subtle sorcerers. 
211 
 WHILE
 RIDING
 ON THEIR
 IRON
 HORSES,
 THE
 MEMBERS
 OF THE
 GANG
 DID
 NOT
 SAY
 A WORD
 TO EACH
 OTHER
 - THEY
 HAD
 A LANGUAGE
 OF THEIR
 OWN,
 WHICH
 THEY
 UNDERSTOOD
 PERFECTLY. 
IN A COMPARATIVELY
 SHORT
 TIME
 WE WERE
 TRANSFERRED
 THROUGH
 LAKE
 SUPERIOR. 
NOW
 ALL
 WE HAD
 TO DO WAS
 GET
 TO THE
 CEMETERY
 ITSELF
 - WHERE
 WE WOULD
 GET
 OUR
 PLEAS
 ANSWERED
 AND
 FEEL
 EVERYTHING.
 BUT
 IT WAS
 HERE
 THAT
 THE
 THOUGHT
 OF WHO
 HAD
 PLACED
 THE
 GRIMOIRE
 IN THE
 GRAVE
 THAT
 HAD
 BEEN
 DUG BY BENZOUR
 RAN
 THROUGH
 MY MIND
 AGAIN.
 THIS
 QUESTION,
 UNDER
 THE
 CIRCUMSTANCES
 THUS
 CREATED,
 ASSUMED
 PARAMOUNT
 IMPORTANCE. 
WE STOPPED
 AT MIDPORT
 IN LA POINTE
 CITY
 TO REST
 FOR A WHILE,
 AND
 THE
 THREE
 OF US AND
 ZONAR
 DECIDED
 TO TAKE
 A WALK
 - NOT
 WITHOUT
 THE
 SUPERVISION
 OF
 OUR
 PATRONS. 
WE FINALLY
 ENTERED
 THE
 CEMETERY
 PARK,
 ACCOMPANIED
 BY A FEW
 OF THE
 ROCKERS
 - THE
 OTHERS
 PREFERRED
 TO LOUNGE
 IN THE
 AREA,
 AND
 WOULD
 ALSO
 COME
 BACK
 A LITTLE
 LATER
 IF NEEDED. 
IN AN AMORPHOUS
 SOCIETY,
 IT WAS
 EASY
 TO SEE
 THE
 LACK
 OF STRUCTURE,
 AND
 HENCE
 EVERYTHING
 ELSE. 
THE
 ENTRANCE
 TO THE
 CEMETERY
 PARK
 WAS
 WIDE
 OPEN,
 BUT
 WE CHOSE
 TO ENTER
 ANOTHER
 WAY
 - HARDLY
 THE
 LATE
 BENZOUR...
 WHAT
 IF THE
 MANTRIC
 HAD
 JUST
 POSSESSED
 HIS
 BODY?
 SUBTLE
 SORCERERS
 WERE
 UNIVERSALLY
 KNOWN
 FOR THEIR
 SPECIAL
 PRACTICES
 THAT
 COULD
 MAKE
 CERTAIN
 PEOPLE
 PERFORM
 CERTAIN
 ACTIONS.
 THEY
 CONCENTRATED
 A SPECIFIC
 NEGATIVE
 ENERGY
 THAT
 HELPED
 THEM
 MAKE
 IT HAPPEN,
 AND
 THE
 RITUALS
 THEY
 USED
 WERE
 KNOWN
 ONLY
 TO THEM. 
212 
 - "KEEP
 THIS
 MOMENT,
 BECAUSE
 IT IS ALL
 YOU
 HAVE
 - YESTERDAY
 HAS
 ALREADY
 PASSED,
 AND
 TOMORROW
 MAY
 NOT
 COME,"
 ARLO
 TURNED
 TO ME, "IN
 FACT,
 NO ONE
 WILL
 REMEMBER
 YOU
 - EXCEPT
 THE
 ALMIGHTY,
 AND
 THE
 ONLY
 REASON
 FOR
 THAT
 IS THE
 FACT
 THAT
 WE HAVE
 A COMMON
 JOB
 TO DO.
 IT IS NOT
 A QUESTION
 OF LOVE,
 BUT
 OF DUTY.
 THESE
 ARE
 THE
 RULES
 OF THE
 GAME!
 AND
 YET OUR
 JOB
 IS TO LOVE
 PEOPLE,"
 HE CONCLUDED. 

HOW
 LITTLE
 I ACTUALLY
 KNEW
 THEM! 
ARLO
 KNEW
 THAT
 I KNEW. 
- "IF YOU
 REALLY
 ARE
 A CREATURE
 OF GOD,
 THEN
 WHY
 DID
 YOU
 COMMIT
 THAT
 TREASON,"
 I ASKED
 HIM
 WITHOUT
 THE
 SLIGHTEST
 FORM
 OF FEAR. 
- 'IT
 IS NOT
 GIVEN
 TO MEN TO UNDERSTAND
 THE
 WHOLE
 DESIGN
 OF HEAVEN,'
 ARLO
 TURNED
 TO ME,
 'AND
 YET
 I SAW
 SOMETHING
 IN YOU.
 I AM THE
 ANGEL
 OF BLESSINGS
32. 
I WOULD
 NOT
 HAVE
 EXPECTED
 SUCH
 WORDS
 FROM
 AN ANGEL
 FOR WHOM
 THE
 DURATION
 OF A HUMAN
 LIFE
 WAS
 TOO
 FLEETING,
 BUT
 I FELT
 RELIEF
 IN MY SOUL-
EVEN IF I WENT
 SOMEWHERE
 BETWEEN
 HELL
 AND
 HEAVEN,
 OR IF MY SOUL
 DISAPPEARED
 AFTER
 A HUNDRED
 THOUSAND
 YEARS,
 HAVING
 BECOME
 A BLACK
 SPIRIT,
 AND
 MY SPIRIT
 WAS
 COVERED
 BY THE
 SHADOW
 OF IGNORANCE.
 AFTER
 ALL,
 EXISTENCE
 WAS
 HERE
 AND
 NOW!
 ONLY
 THIS
 MOMENT
 MATTERED! 
WE WALKED
 FORWARD
 AND
 ZONARA
 SHOWED
 ME THE
 RIGHT
 SPOT
 - IT DIDN'T
 TAKE
 HER
 TOO
 LONG
 TO FIND
 IT.
 IT WAS
 LONELY
 AND
 UNGAINLY.
 FORTUNATELY,
 THE
 WEATHER
 WAS
 CLEAR,
 NOT
 LIKE
 IN MY DREAM. 
                                               
 32 It is about the archangel Barakiel. 
213 
 IT WAS
 MY GRAVE.
 BUT
 HOW
 WAS
 THAT
 POSSIBLE,
 SINCE
 I HAD
 NEV
ER DIED?
 IT SEEMED
 I WAS
 DREAMING
 IN REALITY
 OR JUST
 LOSING
 MY MIND. 
- THE
 MANTRIC
 WANTED
 TO USE
 YOUR
 OWN
 BODY
 AND
 THEN
 TAKE
 IT TO THE
 REAL
 GRAVE
 HE HAD DUG
 FOR
 YOU,"
 ARLO
 WHISPERED
 IN MY EAR,
 "BUT
 WE PREVENTED
 HIM.
 "HE GOT THE
 KNIFE
 IN HIS
 HAND
 FROM
 US AGAIN." 
- "AND
 WHERE
 DID
 THE
 GRIMOIRE
 COME
 FROM
?," WONDERED
 I. ZONARA,
 IN WHICH
 I RECOGNIZED
 MY ARCHANGEL
 OVERSEER
 AND
 APPROACHED: 
- THY
 GRAVE
 WAS
 DUG IN A TREACHEROUS
 MANNER.
 THIS,
 OF COURSE,
 DOES
 NOT
 MEAN
 THAT
 YOU
 WILL
 NOT
 HAVE
 PUNISHMENT
 FOR
 ALL
 THE
 SINS
 IN YOUR
 LIFE.
 YOUR
 FATE
 WILL
 NOT
 CHANGE
 MUCH
 - ON THE
 CONTRARY,
 BUT
 AT LEAST
 YOU
 HAVE
 A CHANCE
 TO SHOW
 THE
 WILL
 TO DO SOMETHING
 GOOD. 
I KNEW
 THAT
 ABRAMELIN'S
 GRIMOIRE
 DATED
 BACK
 TO SOMEWHERE
 IN THE
 FIFTEENTH
 CENTURY
 - THERE
 WERE
 QUITE
 A FEW
 ANTIQUARIAN
 COPIES,
 BUT
 THE
 REAL
 GRIMOIRE,
 WITH
 PAGES
 OF ANIMAL
 SKIN,
 WAS
 BOUGHT
 BY THE
 BRUTAL
 FELISTER
 BECAUSE
 HE APPARENTLY
 HAD
 A PLAN
 - A PLAN
 FOR SOMETHING
 TOO
 BIG. 
- "SO,
 THE
 MANTRIC
 GUS
 BENZOUR,"
 I BEGAN,
 BUT ZONARA
 CUT ME OFF. 
- THE
 MANTRIC'S
 NAME
 ISN'T
 THAT
 IMPORTANT
 - HE NEEDS
 BODIES.
 BODIES
 TO MAKE
 HIS
 PRESENCE
 POSSIBLE
 IN YOUR
 MATERIAL
 WORLD.
 ONES
 HE CAN
 POSSESS.
 BY THE
 WAY,
 TO PERFORM
 SUCH
 AN ATTACK
 HE NEEDS
 A CERTAIN
 LEVEL
 OF SPIRITUAL
 ENERGY. 
214 
 BUT SOMETHING
 WASN'T
 CONNECTING
 AT ALL.
 IF EVERYTHING
 THESE
 CREATURES
 HAD
 TOLD
 ME WAS
 TRUE
 AND
 IT WAS
 EXACTLY
 RIGHT,
 WHERE
 THE
 HELL
 WOULD
 BENZOUR
 HAVE
 BURIED
 IT RIGHT
 THERE.
 THEN
 THE
 BLINDFOLD
 FELL
 FROM
 MY EYES
 - THE
 BOOK
 ALSO
 CONTAINED
 TELEPORTATION
 RITUALS. 
THE
 CEMETERY
 WAS
 FULL
 OF MYSTIQUE
 AND
 AS I SAID
 WE DIDN'T
 ENTER
 THROUGH
 THE
 FRONT
 ENTRANCE
 SO AS NOT
 TO ATTRACT
 THE
 ATTENTION
 OF THE
 GUARDS
 WHO
 WERE
 KEEPING
 A WATCHFUL
 EYE. WHEN
 I WAS
 A KID
 AT THE
 ORPHANAGE
 IN KANSAS
 CITY
 WHERE
 FELISTER
 TOOK
 ME,
 I WAS
 ONE
 OF THE
 BIGGEST
 BULLIES.
 IT WAS
 SO COMMON
 TO SEE BLOOD!
 IN FACT,
 UNDER
 THE
 GUISE
 OF WELFARE,
 MANY
 CHILDREN
 THERE
 WERE
 PLACED
 IN THE
 HANDS
 OF WEALTHY
 AND
 INFLUENTIAL
 ADOPTIVE
 PARENTS
 WHO
 COULD
 PROVIDE
 THEM
 WITH
 BETTER
 CARE.
 OUR
 TEACHERS
 TALKED
 ABOUT
 MORAL
 VALUES
 - AT LEAST
 THAT
 I COULD
 REMEMBER
 CLEARLY,
 BUT
 WE ALL
 KNEW
 WHAT
 A BLEAK
 FUTURE
 AWAITED
 US. 
AND
 THEN,
 UNEXPECTEDLY,
 FELISTER
 CAME
 ALONG.
 HE WENT
 TO GREAT
 LENGTHS
 TO OVERRIDE
 THE
 EDUCATION
 SYSTEM
 AND
 GET
 ME OUT
 - EVEN
 WITH
 SOME
 UNWARRANTED
 LAWYERLY
 GRASPING. 
I REMEMBER
 HOW
 NANCY
 DORAIN
 - THAT
 WAS
 THE
 NAME
 OF THE
 LAWYER
 FOR THE
 ADOPTION
 CASES,
 HAD TOLD
 HIM
 THAT
 MY CASE
 WAS
 ALMOST
 HOPELESS
 AND
 HAD
 EVEN TRIED
 TO REFER
 HIM
 TO ANOTHER
 CHILD,
 BUT THAT
 DIDN'T
 HELP. 
THE
 BEAUTIFUL
 LAWYER
 WITH
 THE
 STERN
 AND
 PROFESSIONAL
 APPEARANCE
 MADE
 IT CLEAR
 TO HIM
 THAT
 THE
 CASE
 WOULD
 BE DIFFICULT,
 IF NOT
 IMPOSSIBLE.
 FELISTER
 WOULD
 NEVER
 FORGET
 HER
 REDDISH
 AUBURN
 HAIR
 AND
 HER
 HORN-RIMMED
 215 
 GLASSES
 THROUGH
 WHICH
 SHE
 SAW
 HER
 VERSION
 OF REALITY,
 STRIPPED
 OF ANY
 UNNECESSARY
 "DETAILS." 
HER
 OFFICE
 WAS
 LOCATED
 IN CENTRAL
 KANSAS
 CITY,
 AND
 IN PARTICULAR
 IN RELATIVE
 PROXIMITY
 TO OVERLAND
 PARK,
 WHICH
 WAS
 A LOVELY
 AND
 PEACEFUL
 PLACE. 
FELISTER
 LOOKED
 AT HER
 SOMEWHAT
 SADLY
 AND
 IT WAS
 PROBABLY
 THE
 ONLY
 TIME
 HE HAD
 EVER LOOKED
 AT SOMEONE
 LIKE
 THAT
 AND
 ANSWERED: 
- MISS,
 AND
 HAVE
 YOU
 SEEN HOW
 THEY
 LIVE
 IN THE
 STREET?
 MANY
 OF THESE
 CHILDREN
 WILL
 PROBABLY
 DIE
 BEFORE
 THEY
 EVEN COME
 OF AGE.
 THEY
 HAVE
 LOST
 THEIR
 CHANCE
 TO DEVELOP
 BEFORE
 THEY
 ARE
 EVEN BORN! 

AFTER
 GREATLY
 ASSISTING
 IN THE
 ADOPTION
 PROCESS,
 THIS
 SAME
 NANCY
 DORAIN
 HAD
 SHOT
 HERSELF
 JUST
 FIVE
 MONTHS
 LATER
 UNDER
 UNEXPLAINED
 CIRCUMSTANCES
 IN HER
 OWN
 APARTMENT,
 WHICH
 WAS
 NOT
 FAR
 FROM
 HER
 LAW
 OFFICE
 - PERHAPS
 MR.
 EMBANKS
 HAD
 "HELPED"
 HER
 IN THIS
 REGARD,
 TO COVER
 HER
 TRACKS,
 OR PERHAPS
 - WHICH
 I THINK
 WAS
 MUCH
 MORE
 LIKELY
 - SHE
 HERSELF
 HAD
 AT FIRST
 VAGUELY,
 AND
 LATER
 MORE
 CLEARLY,
 FORESEEN
 THAT
 THIS
 WOULD
 BE HER
 LAST
 CASE
 IN HER
 LAW
 PRACTICE
 EVER - SO SHE
 HAD
 SPARED
 HERSELF
 THE
 IGNOMINY.
 THE
 WEAPON
 SHE'D
 USED
 TO VIOLATE
 HER
 OWN
 EXISTENCE
 WAS
 A MOST
 ORDINARY
 .38
 CALIBER
 MAGNUM,
 AND
 IT REMINDED
 ME OF THE
 WEAP
ON ZONARA
 HERSELF
 HAD
 USED
 TO BLUDGEON
 THOSE
 BAD
 GUYS
 WHO'D
 CHASED
 US INTO
 THOSE
 WILD
 DESERT
 AREAS
 AND
 GOTTEN
 AWAY
 WITH
 IT. THIS
 IMPRESSIVE
 JURIST
 HAD
 PERHAPS
 MISSED
 OR SUBCONSCIOUSLY
 OVERLOOKED
 THE
 FACT
 THAT
 THERE
 WAS
 A DIFFERENCE
 BETWEEN
 DIVINE
 AND
 HUMAN
 JUSTICE
 - AND
 IT WAS
 NOT
 SO MUCH
 IN THE
 WORDING
 ITSELF,
 BUT
 MORE
 TO DO WITH
 THE
 FACT
 216 
 THAT
 THE
 MOST
 HIGH
 WAS
 A ROYAL
 JUDGE,
 AND HIS
 MODEL
 OF JUSTICE
 WAS
 USED
 BY HIS
 EARTHLY
 VICEGERENTS
 TO BRING
 ORDER,
 BUT
 THEIR
 POWER
 WAS
 LIMITED,
 AND
 THEIR
 ACCUSATIONS
 WERE
 RELATED
 TO SPECIFIC
 GOALS
 THAT
 JUSTICE
 WAS
 ABLE
 TO DEFINE
 AND
 PURSUE
 IN THE
 PROPER
 ORDER
 ESTABLISHED. 

THINKING
 OF THE
 LATE
 HON.
 NANCY
 DOREEN,
 I SEEMED TO SOUND
 LIKE
 A JURIST
 MYSELF-GIVEN
 THE
 FACT
 THAT
 HER
 SERIOUS
 INTERVENTION
 HAD
 BEEN
 INFLUENTIAL
 IN THIS
 WHOLE
 CYCLE
 OF EVENTS
 AND
 SEEMING
 CONTINGENCIES.
 BUT
 SHE
 WAS
 PERHAPS
 THE
 LAST
 REPRESENTATIVE
 OF A GENERALLY
 MORIBUND
 STRATUM
 OF PILLARS
 OF JUSTICE
 WHO
 WERE
 BLIND
 AND
 DEAF
 TO THINGS
 UNSEEN,
 AND
 WHOSE
 ATTENTION
 WAS
 MAINLY
 CONCENTRATED
 ON VISIBLE
 AND
 TANGIBLE
 EVIDENCE
 AND
 CONCEPTS
 THAT
 WERE
 SUBJECT
 TO FITTING
 INTO
 CERTAIN
 FRAMEWORKS.
 IN NORMAL
 CIRCUMSTANCES
 THEY
 WOULD
 PROBABLY
 HAVE
 BOTHERED
 TO INVESTIGATE,
 BUT
 FELISTER
 DELICATELY
 LET
 HER
 TENTACLES
 GO AND
 VERY
 SOON
 CERTAIN
 QUARTERS
 - INCLUDING
 HER
 FORMER
 COLLEAGUES
 CAME
 OUT
 WITH
 A STATEMENT
 THAT
 SHE
 HAD
 ALLOWED
 THIS
 TO HAPPEN
 BECAUSE
 OF SEVERE
 DEPRESSION,
 AND
 THE
 EXPERT
 MEDICAL
 OPINIONS
 ABOUT
 THIS
 WERE
 ALSO
 FORGED
 RELATIVELY
 EASILY.
 AND
 THERE
 WAS
 A GREAT
 DEAL
 OF LOGIC
 IN THAT,
 BECAUSE
 HER
 ASSOCIATES
 - WHILE
 LOSI
NG VALUABLE
 LEGAL
 PERSONNEL,
 ACTUALLY
 SAW
 THE
 PATH
 BEFORE
 THEMSELVES
 AS CLEAR
 ENOUGH,
 STRAIGHTFORWARD
 ENOUGH,
 AND
 UNENCUMBERED
 BY THE
 VAST
 KNOWLEDGE
 OF EVERYTHING
 THAT
 WAS
 GOING
 ON OR HAD
 GONE
 ON AROUND
 THEM
 THAT
 THE
 LATE
 NANCY
 DOREEN
 POSSESSED.
 YET
 ALL
 SELF-DENIAL
 BROUGHT
 SUFFERING.
 IT WOULD
 NOT
 BE SUPERFLUOUS
 TO SAY
 THAT
 I FOUND
 IT RATHER
 AMUSING,
 SINCE
 THE
 FAMOUS
 217 
 PARADOX
 OF ELSBERG
33, WHERE
 ONE
 WANTED
 TO PLAY
 ON PROBABILITIES,
 AND
 HERE
 IT WAS
 A MATTER
 OF INDETERMINACY
 PRESENTED
 IN THE
 SAME
 WAY,
 WHICH
 WAS
 OF COURSE
 ONE
 HELL
 OF A HUGE
 MISTAKE,
 APPLIED
 WITH
 FULL
 FORCE.
 WELL,
 DEAR
 NANCY,
 YOU
 COULD
 SAY
 YOU
 WENT
 EXACTLY
 WHERE
 YOU
 BELONGED!
 AFTER
 ALL,
 ATTACHMENT
 TO ANYTHING
 WAS
 LIABLE
 TO CAUSE
 TROUBLE,
 AND
 LIFE
 WAS
 CONSTANTLY
 CHANGING. 
 
CHAPTER
 NINETEEN:
 THE
 ORPHANAGE 
 
I REMEMBER
 THE
 UNIQUE
 LIBRARY
 OF KANSAS
 CITY,
 WHICH
 WAS
 MANY
 LARGE
 BOOKS
 STACKED
 SIDE
 BY SIDE.
 ITS
 WONDERFUL
 EXTERIOR
 WAS
 TRULY
 FASCINATING
 AND
 WAS
 PROBABLY
 THE
 ONLY
 PLACE
 I FELT
 AT HOME
 WHILE
 I WAS
 NOT
 AT THE
 ORPHANAGE. 
THE
 REGIME
 IN THE
 ORPHANAGE
 WAS
 EXTREMELY
 STRICT
 AND
 NO ONE
 COULD
 COME
 IN OR OUT
 WHENEVER
 THEY
 WANTED,
 AND
 A SPECIAL
 PERSON
 WAS
 IN CHARGE.
 I REMEMBERED
 ONE
 CASE
 OF A VIOLATION
 OF THIS
 RULE
 WHERE
 THE
 CULPRIT
 WAS
 DIRECTLY
 ASSIGNED
 TO AN INSTITUTION
 FOR
 BEHAVIOR
 CORRECTION. 

I RECALL
 PUNISHMENTS
 AND
 EVEN SOME
 BRUTAL
 CASES
 OF STAFF
 VIOLENCE.
 TO THEM
 WE WERE
 NOBODIES!
 TALKING
 AND
 WANTING
 TO LIVE! 
                                               
 33 Ellsberg's paradox is mainly expressed in the concept tha
t 
people tend to act irrationally in making their decision
s, 
preferring a known evil that could be defined in terms o
f 
mathematical probability to the uncertainty that generates
 fear 
in them. 
218 
 FELISTER
 GOT ME OUT
 OF THERE,
 BUT
 GAVE
 ME THE
 CHANCE
 TO SURVIVE
 IN A BIGGER
 HELL
 HE CONTROLLED
 - A HELL
 HE FELT
 AT HOME
 IN. 
WHERE
 EXACTLY
 WAS
 HELL
 AND
 DID
 IT REALLY
 REPRESENT
 A PLACE
 OF ETERNAL
 TORMENT?
 WAS
 THERE
 ANY
 POINT
 IN LIVING
 AT ALL?
 WAS
 THERE
 ANY
 POINT
 IN DEVELOPING
 OUR
 SOUL? 
THE
 DAYS
 IN THE
 BOARDING
 SCHOOL
 PASSED
 RATHER
 UNEVENTFULLY.
 THE
 STAFF
 WERE
 WELL
 TRAINED
 TO TELL
 US THAT
 SOONER
 OR LATER
 EVERYONE
 WOULD
 GET
 THEIR
 CHANCE
 IN LIFE AND
 THAT
 WE WERE
 INDEED
 WANTED,
 AS WE REPRESENTED
 THE
 FUTURE
 OF THIS
 COUNTRY
 AFTER
 ALL.
 EVEN
 THE
 SIMPLE
 STATISTICS
 PROVED
 IT - THIS
 WAS
 NOT
 AN ALTRUISTIC
 ACT
 AT ALL,
 BUT A BUSINESS
 WORTH
 BILLIONS. 
SCRIPTURE
 SAID SOMETHING
 INTERESTING
 ABOUT
 THIS,
 NAMELY
 THAT
 THERE
 WAS
 NEITHER
 WORK
 NOR
 THOUGHT
 NOR
 KNOWLEDGE
 NOR
 WISDOM
 IN THE
 GRAVE
34. MEMORIES
 SENT
 ME AGAIN
 DOWN
 THE
 DARK
 CORRIDORS
 OF THAT
 HELL.
 THE
 BUILDING
 WAS
 NOT
 LARGE,
 BUT
 THE
 CHILDREN
 THERE,
 AND
 THE
 STAFF
 WERE
 DISGUSTING.
 THAT
 EMBODIMENT
 OF THE
 AMERICAN
 DREAM
 WAS
 EASILY
 SEEN TO BE NOT
 WHAT
 IT WAS
 SAID
 TO BE! 
ONE
 NIGHT
 MILES
 CAME
 HOME
 TO ME,
 EVEN THOUGH
 THERE
 WAS
 A BAN
 ON UNNECESSARY
 COMMUNICATION
 BETWEEN
 THE
 VARIOUS
 ADOPTION
 SITES
 - AS THEY
 CALLED
 US,
 IT WAS
 STRICTLY
 FORBIDDEN.
 I DON'T
 KNOW
 HOW
 THE
 BOARDING
 SCHOOL
 STAFF
 HADN'T
 SENSED
 HIM
 AS HE CREPT
 STEALTHILY
 THROUGH
 THE
 CORRIDORS. 

- LOOK,
 ELIZANDER
 CAN'T
 SLEEP
 AND
 I'M
 THINKING
 ABOUT
 SOME
 SHIT.
 IF THEY
 DON'T
 REALLY
 WANT
 US,
                                                
 34 The quotation in question is from (Ecclesiastes 9:10) 
219 
 WHAT
 ARE
 THEY
 GOING
 TO ADOPT
 US FOR?
 I MEAN,
 WHAT'S
 IN IT FOR THEM?
 THE
 STREET
 HAS
 TAUGHT
 ME THAT
 NOTHING
 IN THIS
 WORLD
 IS DONE
 FOR
 NOTHING! 
I TURNED
 BARELY
 PERCEPTIBLY,
 PROPPED
 UP ON ONE
 ELBOW,
 AND
 OUR
 EYES MET
 IN THE
 HEAVY
 DARKNESS
 OF THE
 QUIET
 ROOM: 
- DON'T
 YOU
 REALLY
 WANT
 TO GET
 OUT
 OF HER
E. JUST
 FOLLOW
 THE
 DAMN
 RULES
 AND
 PLAY
 THEIR
 GAME
 TO THE
 END! 
BY THE
 TIME
 I TURNED
 TO GO TO SLEEP,
 HE WAS
 JUST
 GONE
 - SO SILENTLY
 THAT
 I HADN'T
 EVEN NOTICED
 HIM,
 BUT HIS
 WORDS
 GOT ME THINKING. 
NEVERTHELESS,
 THE
 WAVE
 OF DISCONTENT
 COULDN'T
 PASS
 ALL
 THE
 TORMENTED
 CREATURES
 WHO
 HAD NOWHERE
 TO GO! MANY
 OF THEM
 DIDN'T
 EVEN
 KNOW
 THEIR
 PARENTS!
 AND
 ONE
 DAY
 MILES
 JOSEPH
 JUST
 BEAT
 ONE
 OF THEM
 TO DEATH.
 USED
 A BOARD
 PULLED
 OUT
 OF HIS
 COT
 - WE WEREN'T
 IN A PRISON,
 BUT
 WHAT
 I COULD
 CLEARLY
 SEE WAS
 THE
 UNHEARD
 OF BRAINS
 THE
 FEMALE
 OFFICER
 HAD
 DISPLAYED. 
THERE
 HAD
 BEEN
 A TRIAL
 AND
 THEY
 HAD
 FOUND
 THIS
 SAME
 MILES
 GUILTY
 OF FIRST
 DEGREE
 MURDER
 WITH
 INTENT
 TO CAUSE
 THE
 DEATH
 OF THE
 VICTIM
 IN A PARTICULARLY
 PAINFUL
 MANNER
 - USUALLY
 THE
 SENTENCE
 WAS
 LIFE,
 BUT GIVEN
 HIS
 LACK
 OF PRIOR
 MISDEMEANORS
 AND
 HIS
 TENDER
 AGE,
 THE
 JUDGE
 WAS
 VERY
 RELUCTANT
 TO GIVE
 HIM
 ONE
 LAST
 CHANCE
 - EITHER
 GO TO ONE
 OF THE
 YOUTH
 OFFENDER
 CORRECTIONAL
 CENTRES
 OR SERVE
 HIS
 SENTENCE
 IN AN ADULT
 PRISON,
 BUT
 THERE
 HE WAS
 LOOKING
 AT BETWEEN
 TWENTY
 AND
 FORTY
 YEARS DEPENDING
 ON HIS
 BEHAVIOUR
 - HE WOULD
 PROBABLY
 SERVE
 AT LEAST
 TWENTY-FIVE
 THOUGH,
 MAYBE
 MORE. 
MILES
 ACCEPTED
 THE
 DECISION
 THAT
 DOOMED
 HIM
 TO CERTAIN
 DOOM
 WITHOUT
 QUESTION,
 AND
 CHANGED
 HIS
 220 
 LIFE
 BEYOND
 RECOGNITION,
 BUT
 HE STILL
 OPTED
 FOR THE
 CORRECTIONAL
 CENTRE
 - IT WAS
 TOUGH
 THERE
 TOO,
 BUT
 AT LEAST
 HE HAD
 A CHANCE
 OF SURVIVING
 WITHOUT
 THE
 AGGRESSION
 OF THE
 OLDER
 INMATES
 WHO
 WOULD
 INEVITABLY
 TAUNT
 HIM,
 AND
 THE
 CHANCE
 OF BEING
 KILLED
 SOONER
 OR LATER
 WAS
 ALSO
 SIGNIFICANT. 

AT THE
 TIME
 I WAS
 TEXTING
 WITH
 A GIRL FROM
 THE
 ST.
 MARY
 SHELTER
 IN SAN
 FRANCISCO.
 SHE
 WAS
 MY FIRST
 LOVE.
 WE WEREN'T
 ALLOWED
 TO USE
 A COMPUTER
 OR TABLET,
 SO I RAN
 AND
 DROPPED
 THE
 OLD FASHIONED
 LETTER.
 BUT
 A LITTLE
 LATER
 I SENSED
 IN OUR
 CORRESPONDENCE
 WITH
 EACH
 OTHER
 THAT
 SHE
 WAS
 LIKE
 EVERYONE
 ELSE
 - JUST
 TRYING
 TO GET
 OUT
 AND
 SAVE
 HERSELF!
 A LOST
 SOUL
 IN A SEA OF HUMAN
 EMOTIONS!
 ONCE
 SHE
 JUST
 TOLD
 ME THAT
 SHE
 DREAMED
 SOMEONE
 WOULD
 COME
 AND
 GET
 HER.
 AND
 SUCH
 A FAMILY
 APPEARED.
 THEY
 WERE
 SOME
 BIG
 INDUSTRIALISTS
 FROM
 NEW
 ORLEANS.
 IN HER
 LAST
 LETT
ER TO ME,
 SHE
 HAD
 WRITTEN
 THE
 FOLLOWING: 
 "DEAR
 ELIZANDER,
 THIS
 WORLD
 IS FULL
 OF FALSEHOOD
 AND
 LIES,
 OF LACK
 OF LOVE
 AND
 MANY
 HUMAN
 FAILINGS.
 PERHAPS
 WE SHALL
 ALL
 ROT
 IN HELL
 ONE
 DAY.
 BUT WE HAVE
 TO FORGIVE
 PEOPLE
 - NOT
 OUT
 OF LOVE,
 BUT
 BECAUSE
 WE JUST
 HAVE
 TO GO OUR
 OWN
 WAY
 LIKE
 THE
 WORMS
 IN THE
 TREE
 - EACH
 ACCORDING
 TO HIS
 STRENGTH.
 I HOPE
 YOU
 GET
 SAVED!
 YOUR
 JENNY
 MAGOOD" 

LATER,
 HOWEVER,
 I REALIZED
 THAT
 IN THE
 MOST
 UN-AMERICAN
 OF CITIES,
 WHERE
 FRENCH,
 SPANISH,
 CREOLE,
 AND
 SOUTHERN
 ARCHITECTURAL
 STYLES
 AND
 CULTURES
 MINGLED,
 SHE
 HAD
 SIMPLY
 BECOME
 THE
 KEEPER
 OF A BROTHEL
 OF SOME
 SORT. 
MY ACQUAINTANCE
 WITH
 HER
 PROVIDED
 ME WITH
 A SATISFYING
 AMOUNT
 OF CUSTOMERS
 WHO
 ENJOYED
 221 
 THE
 GOODS
 OF FELISTER
'S FARM
 WHILE
 SATISFYING
 THEIR
 NEEDS. 
ON THE
 WHOLE,
 SOUTHERN
 CONSERVATISM
 WORKED
 ONLY
 TO OUR
 ADVANTAGE.
 AND
 WE
 WERE
 PROFITING
 TOO
 WELL
 FROM
 IT! 
AND
 THEN
 THE
 ADOPTION
 BY FELISTER
 CAME
 TO ME LIKE
 A WHISTLE!
 I JUST
 COULDN'T
 BELIEVE
 IT! 
HE DID
 HIS
 BEST
 TO TRIGGER
 THE
 PROCEDURE
 TO GET
 MILES
 OUT
 TOO,
 BUT
 HE DIDN'T
 ADOPT
 HIM.
 HE NEEDED
 ONE
 SON
 - TWO
 WAS
 TOO
 MANY.
 FATE
 WAS A REAL
 SELFISH
 AND
 SELFISH
 BITCH!
 BUT
 MILES
 WAS
 HAPPY
 WITH
 THAT
 TOO
 - IT WAS
 TOO
 MUCH
 FOR
 HIM
 AT THAT
 POINT! 

MILES
 WAS
 ASSIGNED
 TO MIX
 FENTANYL
 WITH
 A FIRST-
RATE
 OPIATE
 THAT
 MADE
 HIM
 LOOK
 LIKE
 A TICKING
 TIME
 BOMB.
 AND
 HE NEVER
 TOUCHED
 THE
 STUFF.
 HE WAS
 VERY
 ACCURATE.
 A GREAT
 COOK!
 NOT
 EVEN ONE
 OF THOSE
 IVY
 LEAGUE
35 YUPPIES
 COULD
 HAVE
 HANDLED
 HIS
 WORK
 WITH
 SUCH
 RESPECT
 AND
 PRECISION-
IT WAS
 LIKE
 A LIVING
 DEVIL
 STIRRING
 HIS
 VAT
 OF MAGIC
 POTIONS. 

BY THE
 WAY,
 FELISTER
 HAD
 AN INTERESTING
 ATTITUDE
 TOWARDS
 ALL
 THE SYNTHETICS
 COMING
 IN FROM
 CHINA
 TOO.
 THE
 NAMES
 OF THE
 PRODUCTS
 WERE
 STRANGE,
 BUT FELISTER
 WAS
 NOT
 NARROW-MINDED.
 THE
 SO-CALLED
 SYNTHETIC
 CANNOBOIDS
 WERE
 THE
 FUTURE. 

THE
 PROBLEM
 WITH
 CANNABOIDS
 WAS
 THAT,
 UNLIKE
 MORPHINE
 AND
 FENTANYL,
 THEY
 COULD
 NOT
 BE JUSTIFIED
 FOR MEDICAL
 USE
 IN ANY
 WAY,
 AND
 THIS
 COULD
 HAVE
 CAUSED
 FELISTER
 MORE
 PROBLEMS
 WITH
 THE
 AUTHORITIES.
 AND
 HAVING
 TO BRIBE
                                                
 35 A group of universities and colleges that are renowned 
as the 
most prestigious in the United States. 
222 
 INCREASINGLY
 INFLUENTIAL
 CONGRESSMEN
 AND
 SENATORS.
 SOMETHING
 HE SUBSEQUENTLY
 DID
 WITH
 GREAT
 SUBTLETY. 
MILES
 DIED
 THAT
 NIGHT,
 AND
 HE WAS
 A GREAT
 FRIEND
 AND
 A CONSCIENTIOUS
 DUDE.
 HE SAID
 SOMETHING
 TO ME I'LL
 NEVER
 FORGET: 
- AT THE
 END
 OF THE
 ROAD,
 YOU'RE
 ON YOUR
 OWN!
 REMEMBER
 HIM!
 BUT
 THE
 TRUTH
 IS,
 ROUGHLY
 SPEAKING,
 YOU
 WERE
 ALWAYS
 COMPLETELY
 ALONE.
 NO MATTER
 WHAT
 YOU
 THOUGHT
 OR FELT
 THE
 WHOLE
 TIME.
 BUT
 FELISTER
 WAS
 LIKE
 A FATHER
 TO ME - EVEN A FAKE
 ONE,
 HE GOT
 ME OUT
 OF THAT
 HOLE.
 OUT
 OF THAT
 CURSED
 AND
 HOPELESS
 CYCLE! 
TWO
 WEEKS
 LATER
 WAS
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN'S
 FAMOUS
 POLICE
 RAID.
 AND
 IT WAS
 ALL
 OVER
 FOR
 HIM
 ON THAT
 PORCH
 ON THAT
 WARM
 MAY EVENING.
 HE WAS
 ALSO
 ONE
 OF THE
 MEN STANDING
 CLOSEST
 TO FELISTER
 AND
 DEFENDING
 HIM
 TO THE
 LAST
 DROP
 OF BLOOD. 

PEACE
 BE WITH
 YOU,
 MILES!
 MAY
 YOU
 FIND
 PEACE!
 AND
 MAY
 YOU
 HAVE
 AT LEAST
 ONE
 ANGEL
 FROM
 BEYOND
 THE
 GRAVE
 TO ACCOMPANY
 YOUR
 SOUL
 AT LEAST
 A LITTLE
 WAY.
 I HAD
 HEARD
 THAT
 THE
 SOUL
 WAITED
 IN A SPECIAL
 SECLUDED
 ROOM
 UNTIL
 ITS
 TIME
 CAME,
 AND
 THENCE
 BY A SPECIAL
 CORRIDOR
 IT WENT
 TO THE
 HALL
 WHERE
 IT WAS
 TO HEAR
 ITS
 SENTENCE,
 AND
 THEN
 RECEIVE
 ITS
 DUE DISTRIBUTION. 
 
CHAPTER
 TWENTY:
 THE
 DISCOVERY 
 
ONLY
 A HANDFUL
 OF EARTH
 COULD
 BE FOUND
 IN THE
 DISINTERRED
 COFFIN,
 MOST
 PROBABLY
 THROWN
 BY THE
 CARELESS
 HAND
 OF GUS
 BENZOUR. 
223 
 - "FINGER
 MAGIC
 IS CRUEL,"
 ARLO
 ADDED,
 AND
 I FELT
 HIS
 ANGELIC
 AURA.
 'BUT
 THIS
 DEED
 IS CONTRARY
 TO THE
 CREATOR. 
- "THEN
 THE
 MANTRIC
 ..."
 I BEGAN,
 BUT I CAUGHT
 SIGHT
 OF THE
 BODY
 OF BENZOUR. 
BELIEVE
 IT OR NOT,
 IT HAD
 FALLEN
 IN SUCH
 A WAY
 IN A CORNER
 UNDER
 SOME
 BUSHES
 THAT
 EVEN THOSE
 PASSING
 BY WOULD
 NOT
 HAVE
 NOTICED
 IT.
 HAD DIED
 THE
 NIGHT
 BEFORE
 WHEN
 HE HAD
 CARRIED
 OUT
 HIS
 ATTACK
 ON ME. APPARENTLY,
 THE
 MANTRIC
 HAD
 SIMULTANEOUSLY
 PERFORMED
 THE
 MAGIC
 RITUAL
 AND
 CARRIED
 OUT
 HIS
 PSYCHOATTACK
 - SO AT LEAST
 ONE
 WAY
 TO SUCCEED
 IN STRIKING
 ME.
 WELL,
 GAS
 BENZOUR,
 OR WHOEVER
 YOU
 ARE
 - WITH
 YOUR
 STONES
 ON YOUR
 HEAD. 
THE
 GRIMOIRE
 WAS
 RIGHT
 NEXT
 TO HIM
 - NO ONE
 HAD
 TOUCHED
 IT.
 I LOOKED
 QUESTIONINGLY
 AT MY COMPANIONS-NONE
 OF THEM
 OBJECTED
 TO MY TAKING
 IT.
 BUT
 I STILL
 WONDERED
 IF IT WAS
 RIGHT
 TO LEAVE
 THE
 BENZOUR
 RIGHT
 HERE.
 IT WOULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 STRANGE. 

THEN
 THE
 ROCKERS
 WHO
 WERE
 WITH
 US MADE
 A SUGGESTION
 - WE'D INVESTIGATE
 THE
 GAS
 BENZOUR,
 SNEAKING
 IT OUT
 UNNOTICED
 SO WE COULD
 SEARCH
 IT - THE
 NIGHT
 CEMETERY
 GUARDS
 MIGHT
 ALSO
 SWOOP
 IN AND
 SURPRISE
 US.
 WE AGREED
 AND
 BEGAN
 OUR
 PREPARATIONS.
 I HAD
 TAKEN
 A SPECIAL
 PIECE
 OF CLOTH,
 WHICH
 WAS
 PROTECTED
 BY A SPELL,
 FOR
 READING
 BY AN ALIEN
 MIND.
 I WRAPPED
 THE
 GRIMOIRE
 CAREFULLY
 AND
 WE SLIPPED
 OUT. 
MAYBE
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 WAS
 LAUGHING
 AT ME FROM
 BEYOND
 THE
 GRAVE!
 MAYBE
 IT WAS
 HELPING
 ME SINK
 DEEPER,
 EVEN THOUGH
 I WAS
 DOOMED
 TO NO END! 
224 
 I REMEMBERED
 DURAITH
'S EYES
 AS HE DIED,
 SHORTLY
 AFTER
 HE KILLED
 ELLER
 - THEY
 WERE
 SOMEHOW
 EMPTY
 AND
 CALLING
 FOR UNDERSTANDING.
 HE JUST
 CLEARLY
 HADN'T
 SEEN A WAY
 OUT
 TO DO OTHERWISE. 
SLOWLY
 AND
 SURELY,
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 HAD
 CREATED
 A COVER
 FOR HIMSELF,
 BUT
 IN THE
 END
 HE HAD
 FALLEN
 VICTIM
 TO HIS
 OWN
 MACHINATIONS.
 OR PERHAPS
 THAT
 WAS
 PART
 OF HIS
 PLAN?
 FOR A MAN
 LIKE
 HIM
 YOU
 NEVER
 KNEW! 
PART
 OF THE
 ROCKER
 GANG
 LEFT
 TO RAM
 HIS
 HOUSE,
 WHICH
 WAS
 IN COLORADO
 - AND
 IN PARTICULAR
 IN THE
 LITTLE
 TOWN
 OF YAMPA
 - A SMALL
 TOWN
 NEAR
 OAK
 CREEK
 - THIS
 PLACE
 WAS
 LIKE
 GODFORSAKEN.
 THERE
 THEY
 LINGERED
 FOR MORE
 THAN
 A WEEK,
 AND
 DURING
 THAT
 TIME
 WE SETTLED
 DOWN
 WITH
 THE
 OTHERS
 IN BIG
 BAY
 TOWN
 PARK.
 THE
 SCENERY
 HERE
 WAS
 SPECTACULAR
 AND
 QUITE
 WILD - AT LEAST
 TO THE
 UNDERSTANDING
 OF THE
 AVERAGE
 METROPOLITAN
 DWELLER.
 HONESTLY,
 I DIDN'T
 TRUST
 THEM
 TO RETURN,
 SO THE
 OTHERS
 AND
 I STARTED
 EXPLORING
 THE
 SECRETS
 OF THE
 GAS.
 WHEN
 THEY
 DID
 ARRIVE,
 WHAT
 WE HEARD
 MADE
 MY HAIR
 STAND
 ON END. 
- 'FUCK
 HIM,
 GUS
 BENZOUR
,' BEGAN
 REGINALD
 GROVE,
 A BURLY
 MAN
 WHOSE
 BODY
 WAS
 COVERED
 IN TATTOOS
 SUCH
 AS A PHOENIX,
 SYMBOL
 OF ASCENSION,
 AND
 A BLUEBIRD,
 SYMBOL
 OF ETERNAL
 HAPPINESS,
 BOTH
 OF WHICH
 WERE
 DONE
 WITH
 GREAT
 SKILL,
 'AS
 IF HE HAD
 NEVER
 EXISTED
 ANYWHERE
 AT ALL. 
- "IMPOSSIBLE,"
 I MARVELLED,
 'HOW
 ... 
ZONARA
 AND
 ARLO
 STOOD
 SILENT,
 AND
 THEIR
 EYES, THOUGH
 STRANGE,
 LOOKED
 AT ME WITH
 SOME
 PARTICULAR
 CURIOSITY
 - PERHAPS
 MY SENSES
 WERE
 BECOMING
 CONFUSED
 TOO,
 AND
 I WAS
 PERCEIVING
 REALITY
 DISTORTEDLY,
 OR PERHAPS
 IT HAD NOT
 EXISTED
 FOR
 A LONG
 TIME. 
225 
 I KNEW
 THAT
 THOSE
 WHO
 WERE
 ABOUT
 TO DIE,
 OR SINCERELY
 WISHED
 TO DO SO,
 WERE
 ALLOWED
 TO SEE THEIR
 GHOST-DOUBLE,
 WHICH
 ENABLED
 THEM
 TO BE AWARE
 OF WHAT
 LAY
 AHEAD
 IN THE
 AFTERLIFE. 
- "WE QUESTIONED
 MOST
 CAREFULLY.
 NO ONE
 COULD
 TELL
 US ANYTHING,"
 REGINALD
 WENT
 ON,
 HIS
 MASSIVE
 BODY
 CRACKLING
 WITH
 STRENGTH,
 FOR HE MUST
 HAVE
 BEEN
 BARELY
 PAST
 FIFTY.
 "DAMN,
 IT WILL
 BE INTERESTING
 TO FIND
 OUT
 THAT
 THE
 FARM
 THAT
 IS SUPPOSEDLY
 IN HIS
 NAME
" 
I COULD
 CLEARLY
 FEEL
 MYSELF
 STARTING
 TO SWEAT.
 IF GUS
 WAS
 PART
 OF THE
 
 LEGACY,
 OR MANTRIC,
 OR ...
 MAYBE
 HE WAS
 THE
 DEVIL
 HIMSELF! 
- "AND
 HIS
 WIFE
?," I HINTED
 LIGHTLY,
 "HADN'T
 HE ENTRUSTED
 HER
 WITH
 THE
 FARMING
 WORK
 WHILE
 HE SUPPLIED
 THE
 RESERVE
 WITH
 PROVISIONS?
 HADN'T
 HE HIRED
 A HUGE
 NUMBER
 OF WORKERS
 TO DEAL
 WITH
 THE
 GROWING
 NEED
 TO HARVEST
 THE
 PRODUCE?" 
- "ACTUALLY,"
 ERALD
 MONSER
 INTERRUPTED,
 "YAMPA
 IS MORE
 OF A SMALL
 UNINCORPORATED
 COMMUNITY,
 AND
 THE
 LOCALS
 DON'T
 LIKE
 TO TALK
 MUCH
 TO OUTSIDERS,
 BUT
 STILL
 ..." 
- "THEN
 WHOSE
 BODY
 IS THIS
?," I WAS
 AMAZED,
 BUT LITTLE
 BY LITTLE
 I BEGAN
 TO COME
 TO MYSELF. 
"THERE
 IS LIFE
 IN CORN..."
 HE HAD
 SAID
 WHEN
 HE PICK
ED US UP ALMOST
 AT THE
 BEGINNING
 OF OUR
 JOURNEY,
 "AND
 WE CRUSH
 IT WITH
 OUR
 FEET..." 
EVEN THEN
 I HAD
 NOTICED
 THE
 STRANGE
 SMELL
 AND
 ... THE
 PECULIAR
 AURA
 - IT WAS
 BY NO MEANS
 UNPLEASANT,
 BUT
 SOMEHOW
 IT AFFECTED
 THE
 MIND.
 GUS,
 HOWEVER,
 HAD
 GIVEN
 HIMSELF
 THE
 IMPRESSION
 THAT
 EVERYTHING
 WAS
 FINE
 - APPARENTLY
 HE REALLY
 DIDN'T
 CARE
 ABOUT
 ANYTHING,
 AND
 THAT
 WAS
 HOW
 HE'D
 GOTTEN
 THROUGH
 LIFE
 TO THIS
 VENERABLE
 AGE.
 226 
 ONE
 IMPORTANT
 DETAIL,
 HOWEVER,
 MADE
 A HUGE
 IMPRESSION
 ON ME - HE HAD
 MENTIONED
 THAT
 THE
 GOVERNMENT
 HAD
 TAKEN
 THE
 MOST
 FERTILE
 LAND
 FROM
 THE
 INDIANS,
 BUT
 AT THE
 SAME
 TIME
 THE
 INDIAN
 TRIBES
 HAD
 TO MOVE
 EVERY
 FIVE
 OR TEN
 YEARS
 BECAUSE
 THEY
 BELIEVED
 THAT
 OVERUSING
 THE
 SOIL
 WOULD
 DESTROY
 IT. 
BUT,
 NOW
 I ASSUMED
 THAT
 THE
 CAUSE
 WAS
 A LIVING
 DEMON-MANTRIC
 THAT
 SOMEHOW
... BUT
 THEN
 I REALIZED
 THAT
 MY REASONING
 WAS
 CHILDISH...
 NOT
 THAT
 IT WAS
 COMPLETELY
 WITHOUT
 MERIT... 
DEMONS
 WEREN'T
 ABLE
 TO TAKE
 HUMAN
 FORM
 DIRECTLY
 - THEY
 COULD
 POSSESS,
 BUT
 THEY
 COULD
 ENTER
 PIGS
 - AND
 THERE
 WERE
 PLENTY
 OF PIGS
 ON FELISTER
'S FARM.
 WAS
 IT POSSIBLE
 THAT
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 HAD
 VISITED
 FELISTER
'S FARM
 WITHOUT
 MY KNOWLEDGE?
 OR TO PUT
 IT ANOTHER
 WAY,
 IN SOME
 FORM
 THE
 DEMON
 HAD
 TRANSFERRED
 ITSELF
 FROM
 THE
 PIG
 TO GUS
 BENZOUR.
 THE
 IDEA
 SOUNDED
 EXTRAVAGANT,
 BUT
 DEMONS
 HAD
 A HABIT
 OF JUMPING
 FROM
 PERSON
 TO PERSON
 OR ... 
- "APPARENTLY,
 THE
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 HAS
 FAILED
 TO KEEP
 ITS
 SPIRITUAL
 HOUSE
36 CLEAN,"
 I SAID,
 THOUGH
 THE
 HIDDEN
 JOKE
 WAS
 DAMN
 FRIGHTENING
 EVEN
 IF ONE
 ONLY
 TOOK ITS
 HIDDEN
 MEANING
 SERIOUSLY. 
I THINK
 ZONARA
 AND ARLO
 UNDERSTOOD
 ME WELL
 AND
 SENSED
 THE
 HIDDEN
 MEANING. 
BUT ACCORDING
 TO THE
 TEACHINGS
 OF DON
 JUAN
 CASTANEDA,
 A BRUJO'S
 SUPREME
 MAGICAL
 MASTERY,
 AS HE CALLED
 IT, WAS
 NOT
 MEASURED
 BY THE
 USE
 OF VARIOUS
 OBJECTS,
 SINCE
 THEY
 WERE
 NOT
 THE
                                                
 36 Don Dickerman's book "Keep the Pigs Out: How to Slam the 
Door on Satan and His Demons and Keep Your Spiritual Hou
se 
Clean" is about such things. 
227 
 SOURCE
 OF REAL
 POWER,
 BUT
 BY FINDING
 A POWERFUL
 PATRON
37 - A REALLY
 POWERFUL
 ONE.
 WAS
 IT POSSIBLE
 THAT
 FELISTER
 HAD
 USED
 THE
 PIGS
 AS EXPERIMENTAL
 MICE
 FOR
 THE
 DEMONS
 TO POSSESS,
 SINCE
 THEY
 OBVIOUSLY
 DIDN'T
 HAVE
 THE
 SPIRITUAL
 RESISTING
 POWER
 OF HUMANS
 EITHER,
 AND
 SUBSEQUENTLY
 THE
 CUNNING
 MR.
 EMBANKS
 HAD
 TAKEN
 ADVANTAGE
 OF THE
 NAIVETY
 OF SOMEONE
 LIKE
 GUS
 BENZOUR.
 THIS
 THEORY
 SEEMED
 MORE
 PLAUSIBLE,
 BUT
 AGAIN
 THERE
 WERE
 SOME
 WEAKNESSES
 - THE
 MAIN
 ONE
 BEING
 THAT
 AS FAR
 AS I KNEW
 GUS
 DIDN'T
 SEEM LIKE
 A FOOL,
 AND
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND
 THE
 ROCKERS
 CLAIMED
 HE DIDN'T
 EXIST
 AT ALL
 - OR AT LEAST
 THAT
 WAS
 THE
 INFORMATION
 THEY
 HAD
 GOT
 FROM
 THE
 LOCALS.
 THINGS
 WERE
 SOUNDING
 MORE
 AND
 MORE
 CONFUSED,
 BUT PERHAPS
 THEY
 COULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 EXPLAINED
 DIFFERENTLY.
  - "AND
 WHAT
 IF FELISTER
 WAS
 SO ADVANCED
 IN HIS
 SEARCH
 THAT
 HE HAD
 DEVELOPED
 SPECIFIC
 ISOLATION
 TECHNIQUES
 THAT
 GAVE
 HIM
 SOME
 FORM
 OF RELIEF
 OR CONTROL
?," I MURMURED
 QUIETLY.
 "THERE,
 BURIED
 DEEP
 DOWN
 THERE,
 WAS
 HIS
 SECRET,
 HIS
 SADNESS
 STEMMED
 FROM
 HIS
 INABILITY
 TO COPE
 WITH
 HIS
 ALLY,
 AND
 HE HAD
 CLEARLY
 TRIED
 SOMETHING
 EXTREMELY
 RISKY,
 WHICH
 MAY
 WELL
 BE HIS
 TRUE
 LEGACY...
 AND,
 IT COULD
 EXPLAIN
 A LOT
 OF OTHER
 CONSEQUENCES
 STEMMING
 FROM
 HIS
 TOO FOCUSED
 AND
 DANGEROUS
 ACTIONS." 

EVEN THE
 ROCKERS
 - HARD
 AND
 RUTHLESS
 MEN WITHOUT
 SOULS
 - LOOKED
 AT ME AS THOUGHTFULLY
 AS IF THEY
 WERE
 READING
 THE
 THOUGHTS
 BENEATH
 MY OWN
 SKULL.
 AND
 NO ONE
 DARED
 TO CONTRADICT
 ME. NO ONE
 CALLED
 OUT,
 AND
 THE
 FIRE
 QUIETLY
 EMPTIED,
 AS IF TO REMIND
 US THAT
 WE WERE
 NOT
                                                
 37  Carlos Castaneda's The Teachings of Don Juan talks about
 this. 
228 
 ALONE
 - AND
 NEVER
 WOULD
 BE,
 THAT
 WE WERE
 ETERNALLY
 WATCHED
 AND
 JUDGED,
 AS ANGELS
 AND
 DEMONS
 ALIKE
 HAD
 THEIR
 OWN
 CRITERIA,
 BUT
 IN THE
 END
 WE WERE
 THE
 VICTIMS. 
- "I
 BELIEVE
 THAT
 FELISTER
 AS A POSSIBILITY
 HAS
 LONG
 SINCE
 GONE
 BEYOND
 THE
 STAGE
 OF CONSCIOUS
 DREAMING,
 WHICH
 ENABLES
 US TO BECOME
 AWARE
 OF THE
 PRINCIPLE
 OF REALITY
 MANAGEMENT,
 AND TO DEAL
 WITH
 THE
 DEMON
 HAS
 RESORTED
 TO A SPECIFIC
 RITUAL
 OR TACTIC
 THAT
 MAY
 HAVE
 COST
 HIM
 HIS
 LIFE,"
 I CONTINUED. 
- "MAKE
 YOURSELF
 CLEAR,"
 CALLED
 REGINALD,
 WHO
 LOOKED
 AS INTRIGUED
 AS A MEMBER
 OF THE
 HELLS
 ANGELS,
 "YES,
 THIS
 GANG
 OF GANGSTERS
 WERE
 JUST
 ABOUT
 TAKEN
 TO REPRESENT
 THAT
 KIND
 OF POWER." 
- WELL,
 JUST
 AS IT WAS
 A CHALLENGE
 FOR A HANDICAPPED
 MAN
 TO HOLD
 HIS
 OWN
 SPOON
 WHILE
 EATING,
 SO IT WAS
 A MATTER
 OF HONOR
 AND
 SURVIVAL
 FOR A FELISTER
 TO ... 
SUDDENLY
 THE
 WIND
 INTERRUPTED
 MY WORDS.
 HE SQUIRMED
 SUDDENLY
 AND
 BRIEFLY.
 PERHAPS
 IT WAS ACCIDENTAL,
 PERHAPS
 NOT!
 MAYBE
 IT WAS
 COMING
 FROM
 THE
 WATER
 TOO!
 YES,
 ONE
 COULD
 NEVER
 BE SURE! 

- AWARENESS
 ON YOUR
 WAY
 IS THE
 MOST
 IMPORTANT
 THING.
 NO NEED
 TO TALK
 - JUST
 ACT.
 THAT'S
 HOW
 THINGS
 WILL
 HAPPEN
 FULLY. 
ARLO
 HAD
 A FACE
 HALF-OBSCURED
 BY THE
 FIRELIGHT
 - AND
 FRANKLY
 LOOKED
 MORE
 LIKE
 A DEMON
 THAN
 AN ANGEL,
 BUT
 I HAD
 LEARNED
 LONG
 AGO
 NOT
 TO TRUST
 THINGS
 - NOTHING
 WAS
 AS IT SEEMED. 
REGINALD
 WAS
 A REAL
 MAN'S
 MAN,
 AND
 HE AND
 DON
 SAULER
 AND
 CONNIE
 BRAITH
 HAD
 DECIDED
 TO STAY
 AND
 HELP
 US IN THIS
 WILDERNESS
 BECAUSE
 THEY
 HAD
 229 
 GIVEN
 THEIR
 WORD.
 YES, AND
 THE
 ROCKER
 WORD
 MEANT
 A LOT! EVEN A BANDIT
 HAD
 TO HAVE
 A WORD
 AND
 KEEP
 IT... 
I DECIDED
 TO EXPLAIN
 TO THEM
 DEFINITIVELY
 WHAT
 I THOUGHT
 FELISTER
'S WHOLE
 TACTIC
 HAD
 BEEN,
 SINCE
 HE OBVIOUSLY
 HADN'T
 HAD
 ENOUGH
 TIME
 TO
 WORK
 THINGS
 OUT
 FULLY,
 OR MAYBE
 HE HAD
 JUST
 DONE
 IT DELIBERATELY
 - NO MATTER
 WHAT
 HAD
 MADE
 HIM
 DO IT - ONE
 THING
 WAS
 ABSOLUTELY
 CERTAIN.
 FELISTER
 HAD REALLY
 WANTED
 TO ACHIEVE
 SOMETHING
 THAT
 WOULD
 STAY
 AND BE REMEMBERED. 
- "THE
 FLOW
 OF ENERGY
 IN THE
 UNIVERSE
 IS QUITE
 STRANGE,"
 I DECIDED
 TO EXPLAIN
 MY POINT
 DEFINITIVELY,
 "IF
 FELISTER
 REALLY
 WANTED
 TO GET
 RID
 OF THE
 DEMON
 AND
 CHANNEL
 IT TO THE
 OTHERS,
 HE HAD
 TO RESORT
 TO AN EXTERNAL
 INTERVENTION
 - LIKE
 AN EXORCISM
 OR SOME
 OTHER
 METHOD,
 AND
 HE HAD
 QUITE
 DIFFERENT
 INTENTIONS.
 WHILE
 DREAMING
 WE HAVE
 THE
 FEELING
 THAT
 ..." 
FELISTER
 DREAMED
 CONSCIOUSLY
 AND
 MADE
 THE
 DEMON
 PEEP INTO
 HIS
 DREAMS
 IN A WAY
 THAT
 HE HIMSELF
 DESIRED,
 AND
 THIS
 ULTIMATELY
 PROVED
 DECISIVE. 

- I MEAN,
 HE DIDN'T
 JUST
 WANT
 TO GET
 THE
 DEMON
 TO JUMP
 OFF HIM
 AND
 LEAVE
 HIM,
 HE WANTED
 TO TRICK
 HIM
 INTO
 FURTHER
 SEARCHES,"
 ASKED
 CONNIE
 BRIGHT,
 WHO
 WAS
 A BIT
 MORE
 INTELLIGENT
 AND
 HAD
 BY SOME
 CHANCE
 MANAGED
 TO GRADUATE
 FROM
 HIGH
 SCHOOL,
 WHICH
 WAS
 A RARITY
 AMONG
 MEMBERS
 OF ROCKER
 GANGS. 
- "BUT
 WHAT
 WAS
 THE
 USE
 OF IT TO HIMSELF
?," CALLED
 BACK
 DON
 SALTER.
 "SO HE WAS
 DOOMED
 TO PERISH!
 DOOMED
 TO DISAPPEAR
 FOREVER.
 BASS
 I HOLD
 EVEN THAT
 NO ONE
 REMEMBERS
 HIM
 EXCEPT
 THAT
 HIS
 NAME
 230 
 APPEARS
 IN SOME
 POLICE
 REPORTS
 OF THOSE
 POLICE
 OFFICERS
 WHO
 DEALT
 WITH
 HIM.
 I DON'T
 BELIEVE
 ..." 
DON
 SAULER
 WASN'T
 LYING.
 WE ONLY
 NEEDED
 FELISTER
 BECAUSE
 WE WERE
 HOPELESSLY
 DOOMED
 OURSELVES
 AND
 HAD
 NO OTHER
 PROSPECT
 OF EXACTLY
 WHERE
 TO GO. 
- "THE
 EXPLANATION
 FOR
 THAT,"
 I WENT
 ON,
 "MIGHT
 ACTUALLY
 BE TOO
 REASONABLE.
 FELISTER
 HAD
 BEEN
 TRYING
 TO
 SELF-MEDICATE
 - IN HIS
 OWN
 WAY,
 WHILE
 INTENDING
 TO DREAM
 CONSCIOUSLY
 AND
 TO DECEIVE
 THE
 DEMON,
 WHO
 WAS
 ABLE
 TO PENETRATE
 HIS
 DREAMS
 AT HIS
 DELIBERATE
 WISH,
 WHICH
 THE
 FARMER
 HAD
 BEEN
 INDUCING
 SINCE
 THE
 OPENING
 OF THE
 SECOND
 DOOR
 OF DREAMING,
 THE
 PURPOSE
 OF
 WHICH
 WAS
 TO PASS
 FROM
 ONE
 DREAM
 TO ANOTHER
 AND
 NEVER
 WAKE
 UP IN A FAMILIAR
 WORLD,
 CONTROLLING
 REALITY
 IN A VERY
 SUBTLE
 WAY,
 AND
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND,
 THROUGH
 THAT
 SAME
 SECOND
 DOOR
 OF DREAMING,
 HE WAS
 ABLE
 TO COMMUNICATE
 WITH
 THE
 DEMON
 IN THE
 AFTERLIFE
 AND
 CAUSE
 IT TO LEAP
 UPON
 THE
 PIGS,
 AND
 SUBSEQUENTLY
 UPON
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 HIMSELF,
 WHO
 HAD
 BEEN
 TRANSPORTING
 HIM
 ALL
 ALONG-WHETHER
 AWARE
 OF THIS
 FACT
 OR NOT,
 BUT
 FELISTER
 WAS
 ON THE
 LOWEST
 POSSIBLE
 LEVEL
 OF HEALING.
 MISTER
 EMBANKS
 HAD
 SIMPLY
 BEEN
 LEANING
 ON THE
 DEMON
 THAT
 HAD
 POSSESSED
 HIM
 DUE TO HIS
 IMPURE
 CONSCIOUSNESS
 IN HIS
 ATTEMPTS
 TO PURSUE
 SOME
 SPECIFIC
 CONDITION,
 BUT
 THAT
 HAD
 SIMPLY
 RESULTED
 IN HIS
 INABILITY
 TO USE
 HIS
 MAIN
 CONSCIOUSNESS
 FOR
 ITS
 INTENDED
 PURPOSE,
 AND
 HIS
 AUXILIARY
 CONSCIOUSNESS
 HAD
 PROVEN
 TO
 BE THE
 LEADING
 ONE." 
DESPITE
 MY RATHER
 STRANGE
 EXPLANATIONS,
 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT
 ALL
 THREE
 OF THE
 HEALTHMEN
 REALIZED
 THAT
 FELISTER
 HAD
 BEEN
 CUNNINGLY
 TRYING
 TO MANIPULATE
 THE
 DEMON,
 LEADING
 IT TO BELIEVE,
 HOWEVER,
 THAT
 EVERYTHING
 IT HAD
 DONE
 231 
 HAD
 BEEN
 ACCIDENTAL
 AND
 UNINTENTIONAL,
 BUT
 THAT
 IT HAD
 ACTUALLY
 GONE
 MUCH
 DEEPER
 IN ITS
 QUEST
 AND
 HAD
 INFLUENCED
 MANY
 MORE
 DESTINIES
 - EVEN THEIR
 OWN. 
- "I
 MEAN,
 THAT'S
 THE
 REAL
 LEGACY
 OF FELISTER
," DON
 SAULER
 SIGHED.
 "WELL,
 I'D
 SAY
 IT'S
 STILL
 REMARKABLE,
 BUT I'M
 FAR
 FROM
 RULING
 OUT
 THE
 POSSIBILITY
 OF SOMETHING
 ELSE.
 I MEAN,
 HE WAS
 JUMPING
 FROM
 DREAM
 TO DREAM,
 ALTERING
 REALITY
 WITH
 HIS
 OWN
 ENERGY
 BODY,
 USING
 HIS
 DREAM
 ATTENTION
38, WHICH
 HE WAS
 OBLIGED
 TO MAINTAIN
 AT AN EVEN HIGHER
 LEVEL
 TO CARRY
 OUT
 HIS
 DESIGN.
  BUT ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND,
 IN SPIRITUAL
 WARFARE
 WITH
 THESE
 DEMONS,
 MANY
 SIDE
 EFFECTS
 CAN
 OCCUR,"
 HE ADDED,
 "YES, WE MUST
 REMEMBER
 THOUGH
 THAT
 THEY
 ARE
 CREATURES
 OF DARKNESS
 AND AS SUCH
 DO NOT
 LIKE
 TO BE BROUGHT
 INTO
 THE
 LIGHT.
 THAT'S
 WHY
 FELISTER
 HAS
 KEPT
 HIS
 EYES
 CLOSED
 - TO..." 
THE
 STRANGE
 WIND
 WAS
 HEARD
 AGAIN,
 DYING
 DOWN
 ALMOST
 INSTANTLY.
 WHO
 KNOWS
 WHY
 - ALTHOUGH
 IT DIDN'T
 GO UNNOTICED,
 SOMEHOW
 IT DIDN'T
 MAKE
 SUCH
 AN IMPRESSION
 ON US THIS
 TIME,
 BECAUSE
 WE HAD
 ALL
 INCREASED
 OUR
 ATTENTION
 AND
 CONCENTRATION
 - AS IT WAS
 ON THESE
 THAT
 OUR
 LIVES
 PRACTICALLY
 DEPENDED. 

NEVERTHELESS,
 I DECIDED
 TO CONCLUDE
 MY FINAL
 INSIGHTS: 
                                               
 38 Elizander's explanations are a carefully researched and acte
d 
upon real technique that is a combination of Falun Daf
a's 
understanding of some specific qigong practices and more 
specifically possible deviations from them, Don Juan's 

Teachings on Dreaming Doors, and Frank and Ida Mae 

Hammond's related to demonic possession and the very natu
re 
of demons as described in their book Pigs in the Living 
Room 
and specifically in Chapter Ten Demonic Manifestations.
 232 
 - I DON'T
 THINK
 WE SHOULD
 ALWAYS
 BE AWARE
 OF OUR
 DREAMS,
 BUT I AM DEFINITELY
 NOT
 OF THE
 OPINION
 THAT
 WE SHOULD
 ALWAYS
 ANALYZE
 WHAT
 IS HAPPENING
 IN THIS
 REALITY
 - SO IT CAN
 BE CHANGED
 AT ANY
 MOMENT
 BY SOME
 LUNATIC
 LIKE
 FELISTER
 WHO
 WANTS
 TO ACQUIRE
 SUPERNATURAL
 POWER! 
ARLO
 AND
 ZONARA
 HAD
 RATHER
 SAD
 FACES
 - APPARENTLY
 ANGELIC
 NOTIONS
 OF MORALITY
 WERE
 DIFFERENT
 FROM
 MY OWN.
 I DIDN'T
 BLAME
 THEM
 - THE
 VERY
 FACT
 THAT
 THEY
 HAD
 ACCOMPANIED
 ME THIS
 FAR
 WAS
 MORE
 THAN
 INDICATIVE
 THAT
 I WOULDN'T
 BE ALONE
 FOR A WHILE
 AT LEAST. 
- "IT MIGHT
 JUST
 BE THAT
 FELISTER
 HAD
 COMMITTED
 VARIO
US BAD
 AND
 CRIMINAL
 ACTS
 IN HIS
 PREVIOUS
 LIVES,
 AND
 BILLS
 MUST
 ALWAYS
 BE PAID
 - ONE
 WAY
 OR ANOTHER,"
 REGINALD
 SUGGESTED. 
FROM
 A BRUTAL
 CRIMINAL
 LIKE
 HIMSELF
 IT WOULD
 HAVE
 SOUNDED
 RATHER
 COMICAL,
 HAD
 IT NOT
 BEEN
 FOR THE
 UTTER
 EARNESTNESS
 AND
 SADNESS
 WITH
 WHICH
 HE UTTERED
 IT.
 REGINALD
 HAD
 BEEN
 CONFINED
 AT FORT
 LEAVENWORTH,
 WHICH
 WAS
 IN THE
 NORTHEASTERN
 PART
 OF THE
 STATE
 OF KANSAS,
 WHERE
 CONDITIONS
 WERE
 ABOMINABLE-THIS
 HAD
 HAPPENED
 TWENTY-FIVE
 YEARS
 BEFORE.
 IT WAS
 INTERESTING
 TO NOTE
 THAT
 IT WAS
 A MILITARY
 PRISON-
THAT
 IS,
 ITS
 MANAGEMENT
 WAS
 IN THE
 HANDS
 OF THE
 MILITARY.
 HE HAD
 MIRACULOUSLY
 ESCAPED
 - AS HAD
 EIL,
 CHAMPS
 AND DURIGHT.
 THEY
 FOUR
 HAD
 THE
 MOST
 WEIGHT
 IN THE
 ROCKER
 PACK.
 AND
 YET WE HAD TO REMEMBER
 THAT
 THIS
 GANG
 WAS
 MADE
 UP OF EX-MILITARY
 AIRMEN
 WHO
 WERE GENERALLY 
THEN
 I THOUGHT
 OF SOMETHING
 BOLD
 AND
 BRUTAL.
 AND
 IT WAS
 GETTING
 DARKER
 ALL
 AROUND.
 THE
 SURFACE
 OF THE
 LAKE
 WAS
 UTTERLY
 BEWITCHING
 - AS IF TO SUGGEST
 TO US THAT
 THE
 MIRRORED
 SURFACE
 OF 233 
 THE
 LAKE
 DID
 NOT
 MEAN
 THAT
 A STRUGGLE
 FOR LIFE WAS
 NOT
 BREWING
 BELOW! 
- "WHAT
 IF WE TRIED
 TO USE
 A KIND
 OF EXTRACTION
 FOR
 ELEMENTS
 OF FELISTER
'S DREAMS
 USING
 THE
 DEMON
 ITSELF!,"
 I SUGGESTED. 
EVEN THE
 ROCKERS
 LOOKED
 AT ME LIKE
 I'D
 LOST
 MY MIND
 - THAT
 SOUNDED
 EXTREMELY
 DANGEROUS. 
I MAY
 HAVE
 FORGOTTEN
 TO MENTION
 THAT
 WE HAD
 MANAGED
 TO PICK
 UP THE
 CORPSE
 OF GUS
 BENZOUR
 AND
 HAD
 HIDDEN
 IT UNDER
 ONE
 OF THE
 ROCKER
 BLANKETS.
 WHILE
 WE WERE
 IN BIG
 BAY
 TOWN
 PARK,
 WE MANAGED
 TO LEAVE
 THE
 CORPSE
 IN A PLACE
 WHERE
 WE COULD
 EASILY
 PICK
 IT BACK
 UP LATER,
 BUT
 THE
 PROBLEM
 WAS
 THAT
 THE
 BODY
 WAS
 DECOMPOSING,
 WHICH
 WAS
 A NATURAL
 AND
 IRREVERSIBLE
 PROCESS.
 AND
 THE
 SMELL
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 ATTRACTED
 SOMEONE
 - IT WASN'T
 VERY
 LIKELY,
 BUT THERE
 WAS
 STILL
 SUCH
 A DANGER.
 FOR THOSE
 WHO
 ARE
 NOT
 AWARE,
 DIFFERENT
 PARTS
 OF THE
 BODY
 CAN
 ENDURE
 DIFFERENT
 LENGTHS
 OF TIME-USUALLY
 THE
 INTERNAL
 ORGANS
 DECOMPOSED
 FROM
 TWENTY-FOUR
 TO SEVENTY-TWO
 HOURS
 AFTER
 THE
 MOMENT
 OF DEATH,
 AND
 THE
 CHANGE
 IN THE
 BODY'S
 COLORATION
 OCCURRED
 AFTER
 THE
 FIRST
 FEW
 HOURS,
 WHEN
 IT TOOK
 ON A REDDISH-PURP
LE COLOR
 DUE TO THE
 PRECIPITATION
 OF BLOOD,
 AND
 WITHIN
 THE
 FIRST
 THIRTY-SIX
 HOURS
 IT TURNED
 A WHITISH
 GREEN
 DUE TO DECAY.
 FROM
 WHAT
 WE COULD
 JUDGE,
 FELISTER
 HAD
 DIED
 LESS
 THAN
 THREE
 DAYS
 AGO
 - MOREOVER
 - THE
 BODY
 WAS
 IN RELATIVELY
 GOOD
 CONDITION
 - ALTHOUGH
 THE
 "FIRST
 LESIONS"
 WERE
 ALREADY
 VISIBLE. 
WHILST
 WORKING
 ON FELISTER
'S FARM
 I DETESTED
 OUTSIDE
 NOISES.
 THE
 PATTER
 OF RAIN
 ON THE
 ROOF
 OF THE
 BARN
 OR THE
 EMBANKS'
 HOUSE,
 RANDOM
 SOUNDS
 COMING
 FROM
 SOMEWHERE.
 POSSIBLE
 ATTACKS
 BY WILD
 ANIMALS,
 WHICH
 WEREN'T
 EXACTLY
 RARE.
 AND
 I 234 
 CERTAINLY
 DIDN'T
 SUFFER
 FROM
 WHAT
 WAS
 CALLED
 MISOPHONIA,
 WHICH
 WAS
 A LOWER
 TOLERANCE
 FOR CERTAIN
 KINDS
 OF SOUNDS.
 EACH
 OF THE
 WORKERS
 THERE
 WAS
 STRICTLY
 FORBIDDEN
 TO SPEAK.
 FELISTER
 TAUGHT
 US THAT
 OUR
 WORK
 WAS
 PARAMOUNT
 AND
 THEREFORE
 WE WERE
 NOT
 TO BE DISTRACTED.
 THE
 SLAUGHTERED
 PIGS
 WERE
 PROPERLY
 SORTED
 AND
 THEN
 RICHLY
 INJECTED
 WITH
 THE
 ENRICHED
 OPIATE-
FENTANYL
 SUBSTANCE. 
ONE
 OF THE
 TRICKS
 EMPLOYED
 BY THE
 INGENIOUS
 BREEDER
 WAS
 TO EXPLOIT
 THE
 FACT
 THAT
 HE NEVER
 USED
 THE
 SAME
 GRIP
 MORE
 THAN
 ONCE. 
ON A SUMMER
 MORNING-PERHAPS
 AT THE
 BEGINNING
 OF THAT
 SUMMER'S
 POLICE
 RAID-
HE ADDRESSED
 US WITH
 THE
 WORDS: 
- SOME
 OF YOU
 WILL
 BECOME
 STRONG
 MEN AND
 WILL
 HAVE
 TO FIGHT
 FOR
 YOUR
 RIGHT
 TO LIFE
 - FIGHT
 FOR
 EVERY
 SECOND
 OF IT!
 AND
 NATURE
 IS AGAINST
 YOU.
 AND
 YOU
 WILL
 HATE
 YOUR
 OWN
 LIFE!
  THE
 GREATEST
 DELUSION
 YOU
 ARE
 DROWNING
 IN IS THAT
 IT IS A GIFT,
 AND
 YOU
 ARE
 IN DEBT
 FROM
 BIRTH! 
HIS
 STRANGE
 SERMON
 WAS
 FILLED
 WITH
 SUCH
 PROFOUND
 THOUGHT
 THAT
 EVEN SOME
 FORMER
 RECIDIVISTS
 WHO
 HAD
 JUST
 ARRIVED
 AS NEW
 RECRUITS
 DARED
 NOT
 EVEN RAISE
 THEIR
 EYES, REALIZING
 THE
 TRAP
 OF THEIR
 DOOM. 
SINCE
 THE
 TURNOVER
 WAS
 SOMETIMES
 ENORMOUS,
 FELISTER
 HAD
 TO RECRUIT
 HIS
 STAFF
 EVEN FROM
 THE
 JUVENILE
 DELINQUENCY
 CORRECTION
 CENTERS. 
BUT WHAT
 WAS
 THE
 NATURE
 OF REALITY?
 THE
 SECRET
 WAS
 THAT
 IT WAS
 WILLING
 TO PLAY
 WITH
 ALL
 SORTS
 OF MATTER
 AND
 ENERGY
 WITHOUT
 IMPOSING
 ITS
 SENTENCE
 AND
 WITHOUT
 DEPRIVING
 US OF THE
 RIGHT
 TO SEE WHAT
 LAY
 BEYOND!
 BUT
 IT CAME
 AT A PRICE!
 AFTER
 ALL,
 THE
 FOOD
 OF SOULS
 WAS
 THE
 ACQUIRED
 235 
 AND
 CONSCIOUS
 EXPERIENCE,
 AND
 THE
 ECHO
 OF SOULS... 

INTERESTING
 PART
 OF THE
 PROCESS
 OF KILLING
 AND
 CASTRATING
 THE
 PIGS
 WAS
 THE
 ACTUAL
 STUNNING
 OF THEM.
 THEY
 GENERALLY
 DID
 NOT
 HAVE
 GOOD
 EYESIGHT,
 BUT
 THEY
 HAD
 GREAT
 HEARING
 AND
 AN EXCELLENT
 SENSE
 OF SMELL
 - PERHAPS
 EVEN BETTER
 THAN
 THAT
 OF DOGS.
 WHAT
 I REMEMBERED
 WAS
 THAT
 THEY
 DIDN'T
 LIKE
 THE
 DARK
 AND
 SOMETIMES
 THE
 MALES
 COULD
 BE EXTREMELY
 AGGRESSIVE
 - SO WE HAD
 TO TAKE
 APPROPRIATE
 MEASURES
 TO PREVENT
 ACCIDENTS
 FROM
 HAPPENING.
 I DISTINCTLY
 REMEMBER
 A FRIEND
 CALLED
 RAUL
 HAVING
 HIS
 ARM
 BITTEN
 OFF
 JUST
 BECAUSE
 OF THE
 DIRTY
 BOARS.
 THAT
 VERY
 DAY
 WE TOOK
 CRUEL
 REVENGE
 ON THEM.
 AND
 THE
 NUMBER
 OF ANIMALS
 KILLED
 ROSE
 ENORMOUSLY,
 WHICH
 ONLY
 LINED
 THE
 POCKETS
 OF THE
 BOGUS
 BREEDER
 WHO
 WAS
 OUR
 EMPLOYER. 
RAOUL
 WAS
 SHOT
 DEAD
 A SHORT
 TIME
 LATER
 PERSONALLY
 ON THE
 ORDERS
 OF A FELISTER
 WITH
 THE
 SIMPLE
 ARGUMENT
 THAT
 HE COULD
 NOT
 WORK
 EFFECTIVELY
 WITH
 ONE
 HAND. 
THE
 PIGS
 DID
 NOT
 LIKE
 THE
 DARK
 AT ALL,
 AND
 ALSO
 THE
 SPECIFIC
 REFLECTIONS
 OF THE
 LIGHT
 THAT
 COULD
 DISORIENT
 THEM,
 BUT
 INSTEAD
 - WE WERE
 DOING
 SOMETHING
 VERY
 PRACTICAL.
 WE LET
 THEM
 INTO
 A SPECIAL
 CORRIDOR
 WITH
 WOODEN
 PARTITIONS
 ON BOTH
 SIDES,
 BEHIND
 WHICH
 WE STOOD,
 WHERE
 THE
 FLOOR
 WAS
 PRE-TREATED
 TO MAKE
 IT SLIPPERY,
 AND
 WE USED
 ELECTRODES.
 THEN
 THE
 POWERFUL
 CHARGE
 STUNNED
 THEM
 AND
 THE
 REST
 WAS
 CLEAR... 
WHEN
 THEY
 SHOT
 RAUL,
 I REMEMBER
 HIS
 EYES
 - HE LOOKED
 A LOT
 LIKE
 THE
 PIGS
 THAT
 WERE
 SCURRYING
 AROUND
 WITH
 NO WAY
 OUT
 IN THE
 SPECIALLY
 ADAPTED
 BARN
 OF DEATH.
 AND
 RAUL
 WAS
 BY NO MEANS
 A 236 
 COWARD
 - QUITE
 THE
 OPPOSITE!
 HIS
 COURAGE
 WAS
 PROVERBIAL
 AND
 ... REST
 IN PEACE! 
LOOKING
 BACK,
 PERHAPS
 THE
 BIGGEST
 MISTAKE
 WE MADE
 WAS
 THAT
 WE VIEWED
 THIS
 "RETURNING"
 HOME
 AS THE
 BEST
 PART
 OF OUR
 TRIP.
 AND
 HOW
 WAS
 THE
 CURRENT
 SITUATION
 ANY
 DIFFERENT
 THAN
 THEN?
 WE JUST
 REPLACED
 THE
 FARM
 WITH
 AN ANCIENT
 RITUAL!
 AND
 THE
 PLINTH,
 OR RATHER
 OUR
 JOURNEY,
 CONTINUED. 

THERE
 WAS
 NO WAY
 TO PRESERVE
 THE
 CORPSE
 OF A BENZOUR
 MORE
 EFFICIENTLY
 SINCE
 WE HAD
 NO ICE,
 NOR
 NITROGEN
 CHAMBER,
 NOR
 ANYTHING
 ELSE.
 IT WASN'T
 A GOOD IDEA
 TO THROW
 IT IN THE
 LAKE
 EITHER,
 BECAUSE
 THE
 DECOMPOSITION
 PROCESS
 HAD
 STARTED
 ANYWAY
 - EVEN THOUGH
 IT WAS
 IN A RELATIVELY
 EARLY
 STAGE. 
AFTER
 THE
 NIGHT
 PAS
SED AND
 WE TOOK
 TURNS
 LOOKING
 AT THE
 HIDDEN
 CORPSE,
 WHICH
 WE HOPED
 WOULD
 NOT
 DECOMPOSE
 COMPLETELY,
 I NOW
 HAD
 A CLEAR
 PLAN
 FOR SUMMONING
 THE
 DEMON.
 I WAS
 AWARE
 THAT
 BOTH
 DEMONS
 AND
 ANGELS
 WERE
 CAPABLE
 OF POSSESSING
 A DEAD
 BODY,
 BUT ANGELS
 NEEDED
 SPECIAL
 PERMISSION
 FOR
 THIS
 PURPOSE. 
INCIDENTALLY,
 ANYONE
 WHO
 DEALT
 SERIOUSLY
 AND
 PROFESSIONALLY
 WITH
 DIVINATION
39 HAD
 TO BE AWARE
 THAT
 THERE
 WERE
 CERTAIN
 RHYTHMS
 CONCERNING
 ENERGY
 -AND
 THIS
 WAS
 ESPECIALLY
 TRUE
 OF DREAM
 STATES,
 WHICH
 COULD
 BE EXTREMELY
 SPECIFIC.
 TO SUMMON
 THE
 DEMON,
 I NEEDED
 A CERTAIN
 AMOUNT
 OF PREPARATION,
 WHICH
 TOOK
 TIME,
 AND
 FOR                                                
 39 Divination is a form of communicating with the afterl
ife by 
summoning the spirits of dead people, demons, angels
 and so 
on, and is commonly used by practitioners of magic. 
237 
 THE
 INVOCATIONS
40 IN GENERAL
 WE HAD
 TO GO BACK
 TO THE
 CEMETERY
 LA POINTE
 - I MAY
 HAVE
 FAILED
 TO MENTION
 THAT
 THE
 DISTANCE
 BETWEEN
 THE
 PARK
 AND
 THE
 CEMETERY
 WAS
 OVER
 FIVE
 KILOMETRES,
 AND
 AS WE WERE
 BY THE
 LAKE
 IT WAS
 EVEN GREATER
 - ON THE
 ORDER
 OF ABOUT
 EIGHT,
 AND
 NOW
 IMAGINE
 WALKING
 AROUND
 WITH
 A CORPSE
 WHICH
 YOU
 HAD
 TO CARRY TO THE
 APPROPRIATE
 PLACE
 - THIS
 WAS
 NO EASY
 TASK.
 THE
 ONLY
 THING
 THAT
 GENERALLY
 WORKED
 IN OUR
 FAVOUR
 WAS THE
 COLD
 TEMPERATURES,
 WHICH
 PROTECTED
 THE
 BODY
 AND
 SLOWED
 DOWN
 THE
 DECOMPOSITION
 PROCESS.
 THE
 ROCKERS
 CAME
 OUT
 STIFF
 TYPES
 AND
 THE
 DISGUSTING
 STENCH
 OF THE
 OLD GAS
 DEFINITELY
 DID
 NOT
 PREVENT
 THEM
 FROM
 DOING
 THEIR
 JOB
 REALLY
 WELL.
 AND
 THE
 REASON
 FOR TAKING
 IT WITH
 US WAS
 MORE
 THAN
 OBVIOUS
 -SOMEONE
 COULD
 TAKE
 IT AND
 THEN
 EVERYTHING
 WE HAD
 FOUGHT
 FOR
 SO FAR
 WAS
 RUINED.
 THE
 DEMON
 IN GUS
 BENZOUR
'S BODY
 OR IN HIS
 CORPSE
 WOULD
 GIVE
 US THE
 REAL
 INSTRUCTIONS
 ON WHAT
 WE HAD
 TO DO TO COMPLETE
 THE
 RITUAL
 ONCE
 AND
 FOR ALL. 
I DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO SHARE
 WHAT
 THOUGHTS
 WERE
 RAGING
 IN MY MIND,
 AS I NEVER
 IMAGINED
 EXACTLY
 WHAT
 WOULD
 HAPPEN
 AND
 THAT
 I WOULD
 USE
 PEOPLE
 LIKE
 THE
 HELLS
 ANGELS
 FOR MY PLANS.
 THE
 REAL
 IDEA
 WAS
 THAT
 THE
 MEMBERS
 OF THE
 HELLS
 ANGELS
 WERE
 BORN
 FOR THIS
 AND
 IT WAS
 NOT
 POSSIBLE
 FOR
 THEM
 TO BECOME
 LIKE
 THIS
 - IT WAS
 A WAY
 OF LIFE.
 THEY
 WERE
 BIKERS
 - THAT'S
 IT!
 THEIR
 PATH
 WAS
 MAPPED
 OUT
 LONG
 BEFORE
 THEY
 EVEN
 GOT
 ON THE
 BIKE. 
ANYWAY,
 SOMEONE
 HAD
 ASKED
 ME ONCE
 WHAT
 WAS
 THE
 PATH
 OF THE
 MAVERICKS?
 NOW
 I CERTAINLY
 KNOW
 THE
 ANSWER
 AND
 CAN
 POINT
 TO A VERY
 WORTHWHILE
 ARGUMENT
 FOR IT.
 THE
 SECESSIONISTS
 HAD
 THEIR
 COMMUNITIES
 FOR
 THE
 OBJECTIVE
 REASON
 THAT
 IT                                                
 40 Invocation means summoning. 
238  WAS
 THE
 ONLY
 WAY
 THEY
 COULD
 THRIVE.
 REMEMBER
 THAT
 BIBLE
 STORY
 ABOUT
 MOLOKH,
 DAGON,
 BELIAL,
 BEELZEBUB
 AND
 SATAN
 HIMSE
LF. I COULD
 HARDLY
 POINT
 TO A MORE
 ELOQUENT
 AND
 CONCRETE
 EXAMPLE
 THAN
 THAT. 
YET
 THE
 BODY
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 BEEN
 CARRIED
 AWAY
 IN A VERY
 TACTFUL
 MANNER,
 AS THERE
 WERE
 NO VERY
 GREAT
 OPPORTUNITIES
 ON THE
 ISLAND. 
ONE
 OF THE
 MOST
 IMPORTANT
 THINGS,
 OF COURSE,
 WAS
 TO BE SURE
 EXACTLY
 WHICH
 DEMON
 HAD
 POSSESSED
 GUS
 BENZOURE-ONE
 THING
 I KNEW
 FOR SURE-THERE
 WAS
 A GOOD CHANCE
 THAT
 IT WAS
 POWERFUL
 ENOUGH
 TO "TAKE
 US AWAY,"
 AND
 IT WAS
 NECESSARY
 TO CONCENTRATE
 OUR
 EFFORTS
 ON GETTING
 CONTROL
 OF IT BEFORE
 IT MADE
 ANY
 TROUBLE.
 DEMONIC
 CREATURES
 WERE
 EXTREMELY
 CUNNING
 AND
 COULD
 BE EXTREMELY
 DANGEROUS,
 BUT
 ONE
 HAD
 TO BE ABLE
 TO HANDLE
 THEM
 PROPERLY.
 HOWEVER,
 FEW
 WERE
 AWARE
 THAT
 THERE
 WERE
 SO-CALLED
 GUARDIAN
 SPIRITS
 AND
 GUARDIAN
 SPIRITS.
 MY GUARDIAN
 SPIRIT
 WAS
 BARAKIEL,
 AND
 MY GUARDIAN
 OR
 OVERSEER
 WAS
 THE
 ARCHANGEL
 MICHAEL. 
BUT THE
 SUBTLE
 POINT
 WAS
 THAT
 THERE
 WAS
 ALSO
 A GUARDIAN
 DEMON
 THAT
 HAD
 TO BE TAKEN
 INTO
 ACCOUNT
 - IN OTHER
 WORDS,
 THE
 DEMON
 COULD
 BE THE
 GUARDIAN
 DEMON
 ITSELF...
 AND
 YET THE
 SUMMONING
 OF ANY
 KIND
 OF DEMON
 CARRIED
 THE
 INEVITABLE
 DANGER
 OF DISTORTION
 OR PERVERSION
 OF THE
 SOUL
 OR POSSESSION
 OF THE
 BODY. 
BUT DID
 THAT
 MEAN
 THAT
 GUS
 BENZOUR
 WAS
 THE
 FELISTER
 HIMSELF?
 OR DID
 HE? 
IT WASN'T
 POSSIBLE-FELISTER
 HAD
 BEEN
 DEAD
 TOO
 LONG,
 AND
 HIS
 BONES
 WERE
 ROTTEN.
 IT WAS
 EVEN
 IN THE
 POLICE
 REPORTS.
 WHY
 ON EARTH
 WOULD
 HE DO THAT
 WITH
 A LIVING
 PERSON
 CARRYING
 HIS
 VERY
 239 
 CONSCIOUSNESS
 - THERE
 WAS
 SOMETHING
 THAT
 WASN'T
 QUITE
 CLEAR? 
WE HAD
 TO CHOOSE
 AND
 GO WITH
 AN OPTION
 - EITHER
 WE'D
 BE SHIELDED
 FROM
 THE
 FORCES
 OF LIGHT,
 WHICH
 DIDN'T
 MAKE
 MUCH SENSE,
 OR WE COULD
 STILL
 MAKE
 THE
 DEMON
 SHOW
 ITSELF
 - WHICH
 WAS
 STILL
 SOMETHING
 - IT DEPENDED
 ON EXACTLY
 HOW
 MUCH
 HE WAS
 ABLE
 TO TELL
 US! 
IT WAS
 THE
 TIME
 AND
 PLACE
 THAT
 WAS
 IMPORTANT
 - WE HAD
 TO BE CAREFULLY
 READY
 FOR ALL
 OF THIS. 
THE
 ROCKERS
 SEEMED
 TO BEGIN
 TO REALIZE
 THAT
 THERE
 WAS
 NO JOKE
 - AND
 WE HAD
 TO BE VERY
 CAREFUL.
 BUT
 HOW
 GREAT
 WAS
 THE
 DEPTH
 OF THE
 CONSPIRACY? 

THE
 FELISTER
 GUARDIAN
 DEMON
 WAS
 DEFINITELY
 SUPPOSED
 TO BE VERY,
 VERY
 BADASS,
 AND
 I WAS
 HONESTLY
 HESITANT
 ABOUT
 WHAT
 METHOD
 OF SUMMONING
 TO USE
 - THINGS
 WERE
 WEIRD
 AND
 STRANGE.
 THEY
 WERE
 CHANGING
 SO FAST. 
THE
 GRAVEYARD
 ATMOSPHERE
 WAS
 CHILLING
 AND
 DISGUSTING.
 APPARENTLY
 THE
 GUARD
 HADN'T
 PICKED
 UP THE
 SMELL
 OF A CORPSE,
 OR THE
 WIND
 WAS
 BLOWING
 IN ANOTHER
 DIRECTION.
 ALL
 IN ALL,
 WE DIDN'T
 HAVE
 MUCH
 TIME
 TO THINK
 ABOUT
 IT AND
 SET ABOUT
 PREPARING
 THE
 RITUAL. 
REGINALD
 HAD
 COME
 TO REALIZE
 THAT
 HE HAD LONG
 SINCE
 TRANSCENDED
 HUMAN
 BOUNDARIES
 AND
 WAS,
 FOR ALL
 TOO
 UNDERSTANDABLE
 REASONS,
 TRYING
 TO FIND
 HIS
 PLACE
 IN THE
 SUPERNATURAL. 
ANYTHING
 COULD
 HAPPEN
 IN SUCH
 AN INVOCATION,
 BUT AT THE
 LAST
 MOMENT
 ZONARA
 STOPPED
 ME: 
- YOU
 HAVE
 TO DECIDE
 IF YOU
 REALLY
 WANT
 TO KNOW
 THE
 SECRET
 OF THE
 FELISTER
 OR IF WE SHOULD
 DO THE
 240 
 RITUAL
 WITH
 THE
 GUARDIAN
 ANGEL.
 CAN'T
 HAVE
 IT BOTH
 WAYS
 - TAKE
 YOUR
 PICK. 
THERE
 WAS
 TOO MUCH
 TRUTH
 IN HER
 WORDS.
 ARLO
 WAS
 FEELING
 DECIDEDLY
 UNHAPPY
 WITH
 US.
 I DON'T
 KNOW
 IF SOME
 OUTSIDE
 FORCES
 WERE
 AFFECTING
 HIM
 OR IF SOMETHING
 ELSE
 HAD
 HAPPENED,
 BUT
 I COULD
 FEEL
 THE
 CHANGE. 
ANGELS
 WERE
 MORE
 SPECIAL
 CREATURES
 THAN
 DEMONS
 - YES, THEY
 COULD
 LOVE
 AND ACCOMPANY
 YOU
 TO A CERTAIN
 PLACE,
 BUT
 THEIR
 NATURE
 WAS
 SPECIAL.
 SOME
 OF THEM
 TOOK
 UP RESIDENCE
 HERE
 - ON EARTH.
 AND
 THE
 CYCLE
 BETWEEN
 HEAVEN
 AND
 EARTH
 WAS
 ENDLESS. 
IF I COULD
 DESCRIBE
 MY FEELINGS
 - I WOULDN'T
 SAY
 I FELT
 HUMILITY,
 BUT
 RATHER
 SADNESS
 AND
 A PARTICULAR
 KIND
 OF WEIGHTLESSNESS
 - THE
 PATH
 OF SUFFERING...
 THIS
 WAS
 FELISTER
 - HE WANTED
 US TO UNDERSTAND
 WHAT
 HE HAD
 GONE
 THROUGH
 IN HIS
 ATTEMPTS
 TO FIND
 DELIVERANCE.
 PERHAPS
 HIS
 SOUL
 WAS
 IN HELL,
 AND
 PERHAPS
 EVEN HIS
 SPIRIT
 HAD
 CEASED
 TO EXIST!
 BUT
 ONE THING
 WAS
 CERTAIN
 - THERE
 I KNEW
 THAT
 FELISTER
 HAD
 BEEN
 DOOMED
 FROM
 BIRTH
 - SEEING
 HIS
 OWN
 DISAPPEARANCE
 AS A MESSAGE
 FOR
 OTHERS,
 MANY,
 MANY
 OTHERS. 
WE DECIDED
 TO SUMMON
 THE
 GUARDIAN
 ANGEL
 AND
 THEN
 SOMETHING
 UNHEARD
 OF HAPPENED.
 I LOOKED
 AT GUS
 BENZOUR
'S FACE
 - IT EXPRESSED
 GREAT
 SADNESS
 DESPITE
 ITS
 DECAY
 AND
 DEFORMITY.
 THEN
 I CLEARLY
 FELT
 THE
 CHILLS
 ON MY BODY... 
FELISTER
'S STRANGE
 FACE
 WOULD
 NEVER
 BE THE
 SAME
 AGAIN,
 AND
 GUS
 BENZOIR
 HAD
 MANAGED
 TO FOOL
 US WELL
 - PROBABLY
 BETTER
 THAN
 EVEN HE HIMSELF.
 BUT SOMETHING
 DIDN'T
 ADD
 UP IN THE
 WHOLE
 STORY
 - IF THERE
 WAS
 ACTUALLY
 A WAY
 TO SUMMON
 A GUARDIAN
 ANGEL
 - YOU
 NEEDED
 A SPIRITUALLY
 PURE
 241 
 PERSON,
 AND
 THEN
 ZONARA
 APPLIED
 THE
 ARLO
 HIMSELF
 - WELL,
 HE WASN'T
 EXACTLY
 AN INFANT,
 BUT
 HE WAS
 OVER
 TWENTY-FIVE
 AND
 ... TO MY AMAZEMENT,
 THINGS
 WORKED
 OUT
 AND
 I BEGAN
 TO REALIZE
 THAT
 OTHER
 THINGS
 WERE
 VALUABLE
 IN ALL
 THIS
 - PURITY
 AND
 FAITH
 WERE
 REQUIRED. 
- "I
 CAN
 REVEAL
 UNEARTHLY
 SECRETS
 TO YOU,"
 THE
 GUARDIAN
 ANGEL
 REPLIED,
 "BUT
 I CAN
 ALSO
 SHOW
 YOU
 THINGS
 BEFORE
 YOUR
 EYES THAT
 ARE
 NOT
 OF SUCH
 VALUE,
 BUT
 TO MOST
 MERE
 MORTALS
 ARE
 OF IMPORTANCE." 

CERTAINLY
 THIS
 CREATURE'S
 BEARING
 WAS
 MAJESTIC.
 I DON'T
 WANT
 TO TALK
 ABOUT
 THE
 EXTREMELY
 PURE
 AURA
 IT GAVE
 OFF
 - IT WAS
 SIMPLY
 WONDERFUL
 AND
 SPIRITUALIZING,
 FILLED
 WITH
 EXTREMELY
 POSITIVE
 VIBES. 

THE
 ROCKERS
 WERE
 LIKE
 FROZEN
 AND
 DEFINITELY
 DARED
 NOT
 ROAR,
 LEST
 THEY
 SPOIL
 THE
 MAGIC. 
- "TELL
 ME WHERE
 FELISTER
 DREW
 HIS
 STRENGTH
 FROM
 HERE
 - ON EARTH,"
 I TURNED
 TO THE
 ANGEL. 
THIS
 PARTICULAR
 QUESTION
 WAS
 PROMPTED
 BY THE
 EXTREMELY
 LARGE-SCALE
 GAMES
 OF FELISTER
 HIMSELF,
 WHICH
 I SUSPECTED
 WERE
 MUCH
 DEEPER
 THAN
 THE
 NORMAL
 MIND
 WAS
 CAPABLE
 OF ACCEPTING. 
- "SINCE
 YOU
 HAVE
 SUMMONED
 ME ARIGHT,
 YOU
 WILL
 LEARN
 ALL
 THIS,"
 REPLIED
 THE
 ANGEL
 SADLY. 
SUDDENLY
 IMPRESSIVE
 PICTURES
 BEGAN
 TO APPEAR
 IN MY MIND'S
 EYE,
 SHOWING
 THE
 WHOLE
 OF FELISTER
'S ACTIVITIES
 IN REGARD
 TO THE
 GRAND
 ORGANIZATION
 OF HIS
 KIND
 OF BUSINESS-SOME
 OF THEM
 FAMILIAR
 TO ME, OTHERS
 SPRINGING
 INTO
 MY MIND
 FOR THE FIRST
 TIME. 
242 
 I EASILY
 LEARNED
 THAT
 THE
 POLITICIANS
 IN NOVA
 SCOTIA
 WERE
 NOT
 ALTOGETHER
 INDIFFERENT
 TO HIS
 MONEY,
 WHICH
 APPARENTLY
 DROVE
 CERTAIN
 MECHANISMS
 WITH
 THE
 INDIAN
 RESERVATIONS.
 I SAW
 HOW
 HE HAD
 CONGRESSMEN
 AND
 SENATORS
 UP HIS
 SLEEVE
 AND
 HOW
 HE PLA
YED THE
 UNIONS.
 BUT
 I ALSO
 SAW
 A DIRTY
 SECRET
 - FELISTER
 HAD
 LOST
 PARTS
 OF HIS
 SOUL
 THE
 FIRST
 TIME
 HE MISINVOCATION
 WHEN
 HE LOST
 CONTROL.
 I ALSO
 SAW
 THE
 STRANGE
 METAMORPHOSIS
 IN HIS
 MIND
 - ALL
 THE
 RESULTING
 SUFFERING
 AND
 ANGUISH,
 AND
 FELISTER
 KNEW
 EVEN THEN
 THAT
 HE HAD
 LOST
 THE
 BATTLE.
 SO MANY
 VICISSITUDES
 OF FATE!
 SO MANY
 FALSE
 IDEALS! 
AFTER
 A WHILE
 MORE
 THE
 ANGEL
 DISAPPEARED,
 BUT BEFORE
 HE DID
 SO HE ADDED
 THAT
 THE
 LATEST
 FACTS
 SURROUNDING
 FELISTER
'S LIFE
 WERE
 TO BE FOUND
 IN A NEW
 SCOTIA
 IN CANADA. 
IT TOOK
 US TOO LONG
 TO RECOVER
 FROM
 THE
 SURPRISE
 - SO MANY
 DIFFERENT
 SITUATIONS
 STRANGELY
 INTERTWINED.
 IT CAME
 OUT
 THAT
 FELISTER
 COULD
 AFFORD
 A LOT
 MORE
 THAN
 WHAT
 WE ASSUMED
 HE WAS
 CAPABLE
 OF. BUT WHAT
 THE
 ANGEL
 REVEALED
 TO US CONCERNING
 OUR
 DESTINIES
 EXCEEDED
 MY WILDEST
 DREAMS.
 FELISTER
 HAD
 BROUGHT
 US TOGETHER
 BECAUSE
 ONLY
 AS A TEAM
 COULD
 WE REVEAL
 HIS
 DESIGN.
 IT TURNED
 OUT
 THAT
 HE HAD
 BEEN
 USING
 A SECRET
 MAGICAL
 CODE,
 AND
 IN THE
 END
 IT WAS
 HIS
 BURNING
 DESIRE
 FOR THE
 DEMON. 
TRUTH
 BE TOLD,
 I FINALLY
 REALIZED
 CLEAR
LY THAT
 FELISTER
'S LIFE
 HAD
 BEEN
 PRETTY
 MEANINGLESS,
 BUT
 MANY
 HAD
 LIVED
 AND
 MANAGED
 TO SURVIVE
 UNDER
 HIM
 - THAT
 WAS
 HIS
 MAIN
 MERIT. 
243 
 STILL,
 MOST
 LIKELY
 - BESIDES
 THE
 GRIMOIRE,
 WHICH
 WAS
 OBVIOUSLY
 VALUABLE
 AND
 EXPENSIVE,
 FELISTER
 HAD
 PROBABLY
 LEFT
 SOMETHING
 ELSE
 BEHIND. 
THE
 ROCKERS
 DIDN'T
 SEEM
 DISAPPOINTED
 AT ALL,
 THOUGH
 - ON THE
 CONTRARY
 - THEY
 KNEW
 THAT
 THEY
 WERE
 GOING
 TO GET
 RICH
 LOOT
 IN A NEW
 SCOTIA,
 BUT THEY
 ALSO
 CLEARLY
 REALIZED
 THAT
 SOME
 OF THE
 DRUGS
 HAD
 BEEN
 PLACED
 BY FELISTER
 HIMSELF. 
FELISTER
 EMBANKS
 HAD
 LIVED
 AND
 DIED
 AS HE HAD WISHED,
 BUT
 STRANGELY
 WHY
 THERE
 WAS
 SOMETHING
 ELSE
 TO THE
 STORY
 ELUDED
 US. 
HOW
 HE HAD
 ESCAPED
 THE
 RETRIBUTION
 OF THE
 CARTELS,
 BUT
 HAD
 RECEIVED
 IT AT THE
 HAND
 OF HIS
 COMPANION,
 ZONARA.
 IT WAS
 ONLY
 AFTER
 I UNDERSTOOD
 HER
 ANGELIC
 NATURE
 THAT
 THINGS
 BEGAN
 TO FALL
 INTO
 PLACE.
 SHE
 HAD
 INDEED
 MANAGED
 TO PREVENT
 MANY
 MORE
 DISASTERS.
 THE
 STRANGE
 THING
 WAS
 THAT
 THE
 BANDITS
 WHO
 FOLLOWED
 US,
 WHETHER
 WILLINGLY
 OR NOT,
 WERE
 AS IF IN A DAZE
 AND
 COULD
 NOT
 RESIST. 
PERHAPS
 BLUEBIRD
 HAD
 WANTED
 ME
 TO KNOW
 THAT,
 TOO... 

OUR
 DEPARTURE
 FOR
 CANADA
 WAS
 PROBABLY
 REALLY
 THE
 LAST
 PART
 OF OUR
 JOURNEY,
 WHICH
 WAS
 TO REVEAL
 THE
 DARKEST
 PARTS
 OF FELISTER
'S CHARACTER.
 HOW
 MANY
 FALSE
 HOPES
 WERE
 DASHED
 IN HIS
 SLAUGHTERHOUSE?
 HOW
 MANY
 LIVES
 WERE
 USED
 TO FURTHER
 ... 
CANADA
 WAS
 WONDERFUL,
 BUT
 HERE
 I REALIZED
 THAT
 OF MY COMPANIONS,
 ONLY
 ZONARA
 AND
 ARLO
 WERE
 LEFT.
 THE
 MONEY
 THE
 ROCKERS
 GOT THROUGH
 THE
 DEMON'S
 INVOCATION,
 WHICH
 POINTED
 OUT
 TO US SOME
 HIDDEN
 RICHES
 - AND
 MORE
 SPECIFICALLY,
 WHERE
 THE
 BLUEBIRD'S
 GOLD
 WAS
 BURIED,
 WAS
 244 
 ENOUGH
 FOR
 THEM,
 AND
 THEY
 WENT
 BACK
 TO THEIR
 OLD HABITS
 OF MOTORCYCLE
 PLUNDER. 
- "THAT'LL
 DO US FOR
 QUITE
 A WHILE,"
 REGINALD
 CALLED,
 AND
 THE
 OTHER
 TWO
 AGREED,
 "YOU
 MIGHT
 AS WELL
 MOVE
 ON TO A NEW
 SCOTCH-PLANT
 ON YOUR
 OWN." 

BLUEBIRD'S
 GOLD
 WAS
 RIGHT
 IN LA POINTE
 CEMETERY
 - UNDER
 A TREE
 - ABOUT
 - THREE
 OR FOUR
 FEET
 DEEP,
 APPARENTLY
 THE
 OUTLAW
 HAD
 BURIED
 IT THERE
 FAIRLY
 RECENTLY
 - MAYBE
 A YEAR
 OR SO AGO.
 WHEN
 WE CLEARED
 THE
 DIRT,
 WE FOUND
 IT - IT PROBABLY
 HAD
 AT LEAST
 TEN
 POUNDS
 OF NET
 WEIGHT,
 WHI
CH WAS
 ESTIMATED
 AT OVER
 SIX
 HUNDRED
 THOUSAND
 DOLLARS.
 IN THE
 PAST,
 FEW
 OF HIS
 ANCESTORS
 HAD
 CONSIDERED
 GOLD
 TO BE OF ANY
 VALUE
 AT ALL,
 BUT IN THESE
 TIMES,
 BLUEBIRD
 HAD
 DECIDED
 TO REASSURE
 HIMSELF
 BY SECURING
 CAPITAL
 AND
 LEAVING
 THE
 RESERVATION
 LANDS
 FOR GOOD - YET
 FROM
 WHAT
 THE
 DEMON
 HAD
 SAID,
 BLUEBIRD
 COULD
 TELL
 THAT
 BLUEBIRD
 HAD
 SENSED
 THE
 CHANGING
 SITUATION
 AND
 BIG
 BROTHER'S
 AMBITIONS
 TO COMPLETELY
 SUPPLANT
 HIM
 IN RUNNING
 THE
 GAMBLING
 BUSINESS. 
BY A STRANGE
 COINCIDENCE
 WE LEARNED
 THAT
 SINGING
 SHADOW
 HAD
 DIED
 AND
 BEEN
 BURIED
 ACCORDING
 TO INDIAN
 TRADITIONS. 
NO MATTER
 HOW
 MUCH
 I BEAT
 MY HEAD,
 I DIDN'T
 REALIZE
 THE
 MOST
 IMPORTANT
 THING.
 WHY
 RAUL HAD
 BECOME
 THE
 SCAPEGOAT
 AND
 WHAT
 HAD
 PROMPTED
 FELISTER
 TO HAVE
 THEM
 SHOOT
 AT HIM.
 BUT
 A SUDDEN
 MEMORY
 THAT
 POPPED
 INTO
 MY MIND
 GAVE
 ME A REASONABLE
 ENOUGH
 EXPLANATION. 
- "LIFE
 IS NOT
 FOR THE
 WEAK,"
 HE HAD
 PRONOUNCED
 HIMSELF.
 "WE MUST
 DO OUR
 PART
 AND
 THAT
 IS PARAMOUNT
 TO OUR
 SURVIVAL.
 TAKE
 A CUE FROM
 THE
 245 
 PIGS
 THEMSELVES
 - THEY
 ARE
 SO EMOTIONALLY
 INTENSE!
 AND
 THEY
 KNOW
 HOW
 TO GET
 THEIRS!" 
ONE
 OF THE
 STRANGEST
 TRICKS
 THAT
 WAS
 IMPLEMENTED
 BY THE
 GREEDY
 BREEDER
 WAS
 TO GIVE
 MARIJUANA
 TO HIS
 PIGS.
 THIS
 PRACTICE
 WAS
 NOT
 UNIQUE,
 BUT
 IT WAS
 BY NO MEANS
 COMMON
 - GAINING
 WEIGHT
 ON THE
 ANIMAL
 ITSELF
 MEANT
 MORE
 FENTANYL-OPIATE
 INJECTIONS
 TO DRIVE
 THE
 BUSINESS
 FURTHER
 AND
 FURTHER.
 FELISTER
 HAD
 ELEVATED
 THIS
 PRACTICE
 INTO
 A VERITABLE
 CULT! 
 
CHAPTER
 TWENTY-ONE:
 THE
 RESIDENCY 
 
IN CANADA,
 THE
 THREE
 OF US DECIDED
 TO PART
 WAYS-
BUT THERE
 WAS
 A PLACE
 IN BRITISH
 COLUMBIA,
 AND
 THAT'S
 WHERE
 WE REUNITED.
 EVERY
 DETAIL
 OF THE
 BREEDER'S
 PAST
 LIFE
 WAS
 CAPTURED
 IN THE
 ATMOSPHERE
 OF THAT
 PLACE
 - IT WAS
 THE
 FACE
 OF THE
 TOWN
 OF KAMLOOPS.
  AND
 FROM
 ALL
 THAT
 WE HAD
 COME
 TO, WE CAME
 TO THE
 CONCLUSION
 THAT
 FELISTER
 HAD
 BRIEFLY
 RESIDED
 HERE,
 AND
 FROM
 THEN
 ON HIS TRAIL
 WAS
 IRRETRIEVABLY
 LOST.
 AND
 NO ONE
 COULD
 REMEMBER
 ANYTHING
 AT ALL
 ABOUT
 HIMSELF. 
THERE
 WAS
 AN OLD BUILDING
 ON THE
 OUTSKIRTS
 OF THE
 TOWN
 THAT
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 BELONGED
 TO HIM-YOU
 ASK
 HOW
 WE KNEW.
 HERE
 THE
 INTUITION
 OF ARLO,
 WHO
 HAD
 RESOLVED
 TO TAKE
 A MORE
 ACTIVE
 PART
 IN DISCOVERING
 HIS
 SECRET,
 HELPED
 EXCEEDINGLY. 
THE
 HOUSE
 WAS
 IN TYPICAL
 VICTORIAN
 STYLE
 - QUITE
 BEAUTIFUL
 AND
 BLOOD-CHILLING.
 WE WALKED
 AROUND
 IT SEVERAL
 TIMES
 FROM
 A VERY
 DISCREET
 246 
 DISTANCE
 SO AS NOT
 TO ATTRACT
 THE
 ATTENTION
 OF THE
 NEIGHBOURS. 
IT WOULD
 NOT
 BE SUPERFLUOUS
 TO MENTION
 THE
 IMPRESSIVE
 THREE-STOREY
 BUILDING
 WITH
 A BRICK
 FACADE,
 WHICH
 WAS
 NOW
 RATHER
 RUN DOWN
 AND YET
 ITS
 APPEARANCE
 WAS
 A PECULIAR
 MIX
 BETWEEN
 NOSTALGIC
 ATMOSPHERE
 AND
 MELANCHOLY.
 APPARENTLY
 WE HAD
 TO GET
 INSID
E, BUT
 WE STILL
 DIDN'T
 KNOW
 HOW,
 AND
 THERE
 WAS
 NO DOORMAN
 ANYWHERE.
 HER
 GARDEN
 WAS
 DEFINITELY
 NEGLECTED,
 AND
 HER
 LAWN
 WAS
 MOWED
 REGULARLY
 ONLY
 THANKS
 TO THE 
- "A
 TRUE
 SEEKER
 SHOULD
 HAVE
 A SENSE
 OF THIS,"
 ARLO
 SAID,
 WRINKLING
 HIS
 NOSE,
 "I SMELL
 FELISTER
 HAS
 BEEN
 HERE
 A LONG
 TIME
 - HIS
 AURA
 IS STILL
 IN THE
 AIR." 

FATHER
 TOBIAS
 DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO STAND
 THERE
 WITH
 HIS
 ARMS
 FOLDED,
 BUT
 HAD
 DECIDED
 TO HELP
 US.
 WE CONTACTED
 HIM
 IN A VERY
 SPECIFIC
 WAY.
 THE
 ANGELIC
 AURA
 OF MY COMPANIONS
 WAS
 APPARENTLY
 TRANSMITTED
 EVEN
 THROUGH
 THE
 TELEPHONE
 RECEIVER.
 THIS
 FIELD
 OF RADIANT
 LIGHT
 WAS
 IMPRESSIVE. 

IT WAS
 INTERESTING
 THAT
 FATHER
 TOBIAS'S
 INITIALLY
 STERN
 VOICE
 GRADUALLY
 SOFTENED
 AND
 HE AGREED
 TO TELL
 US SOME
 THINGS
 HE HAD ASSUMED
 ABOUT
 THE
 FELISTER. 

- THIS
 CONVERSATION
 IS NOT
 FOR
 OVER
 THE
 PHONE,
 HE HAD
 SAID
 BUSINESSLIKE,
 BUT
 WHEN
 WE EXPLAINED
 THAT
 WE WERE
 NOW
 AT A GREAT
 DISTANCE
 FROM
 THE
 ABBEY
 AND
 HAD
 FOLLOWED
 FELISTER
'S STORY
 SOMEWHAT,
 HE FELL
 SILENT
 FOR
 A MOMENT
 AND
 ... SAID
 VERY
 CAREFULLY: 
- I FEEL
 A STRANGE
 MIXING
 OF ENERGIES,
 POSITIVE
 AND
 NEGATIVE,
 WHICH
 BOTH
 PASS
 THROUGH
 AND
 SEEM TO 247 
 FLOW
 INTO
 ME.
 I WILL
 SEND
 YOU
 A CODED
 MESSAGE
 LATER
 AND
 THAT
 IS ALL
 I CAN
 DO FOR YOU.
 THE
 TRUE
 SPIRITUAL
 SEEKER
 MUST
 TAKE
 CARE
 OF HIS
 OWN
 SALVATION. 

WHILE
 WAITING
 FOR THE
 CODED
 MESSAGE
 THE
 ABBOT
 PROMISED
 TO SEND
 AFTER
 ALL,
 WE SLIPPED
 IN THROUGH
 THE
 BACK
 ENTRANCE
 - ME, ZONARA
 AND
 ARLO.
 IT WAS
 NOT
 SO MUCH
 EXCITING
 AS DANGEROUS.
 PERHAPS
 FELISTER
 HAD
 CAST
 PROTECTIVE
 SPELLS
 THAT
 WERE
 STILL
 IN EFFECT,
 OR PERHAPS
 THERE
 WAS
 SOMETHING
 TRULY
 DANGEROUS
 AND
 MALEVOLENT
 IN THE
 HOUSE.
 BUT
 THAT
 WAS
 PURE
 CONJECTURE.
 FROM
 THE
 ROCKERS
 I HAD
 EQUIPPED
 MYSELF
 WITH
 A SPECIAL
 SPITZER
 WITH
 WHICH
 I COULD
 OPEN
 VARIOUS
 LOCKS,
 AND
 THIS
 PROVED
 DECISIVE
 FOR
 LATER
 ON. 
I LOOKED
 UP AT THE
 SKY
 FOR
 A MOME
NT - I DON'T
 KNOW
 IF I WAS
 MYSELF
 AT THAT
 MOMENT!
 BUT
 THERE
 WAS
 NO SIGN
 OF ANY
 BLUEBIRDS,
 FOR THERE
 WERE
 SOME
 GULLS
 SOARING
 IN THE
 GREYISH
 AND
 HEAVY
 SKY,
 WHICH
 HAD
 COME
 FROM
 WHO
 KNOWS
 WHERE.
 THEIR
 SYMBOLIC
 NATURE
 ALMOST
 MADE
 ME SMILE,
 AS THEY
 REVEALED
 THAT
 IN THE
 FREEDOM
 AND
 CAREFREE
 WAY
 OF LIFE. 
ALAS,
 I DIDN'T
 HAVE
 TIME
 TO PONDER,
 FOR
 ZONARA
 TUGGED
 AT MY SLEEVE: 
- WHAT
 HAVE
 YOU
 GOT YOURSELF
 INTO?
 WE SHOULD
 USE
 SPURS!
 FASTER! 
- "SEE,"
 I ANSWERED
 HER,
 "EVEN
 THE
 SKY
 IS GIVING
 US A SIGN." 
I NEED
 NOT
 DESCRIBE
 HER STRANGE
 GRIMACE
 - IT WAS
 UNTRANSLATABLE
 IN WORDS. 
BUT WE SOON
 GOT
 INTO
 FELISTER
'S HOUSE-THE
 REAL
 ONE
 HE HAD
 INHABITED.
 IT APPEARED
 THAT
 HE HAD NOT
 248 
 LIVED
 BADLY
 AT ALL,
 NOR
 SO SCANTILY
 AS WE HAD
 SUPPOSED. 

ARLO
 WAS
 STARING
 AT SOME
 OF THE
 ARTIFACTS
 THAT
 HAD
 COLLECTED
 A THICK
 LAYER
 OF DUST. 
BUT WE HADN'T
 COME
 TO LOOK,
 WE HAD
 COME
 TO SEEK ANSWERS. 

AFTER
 A METICULOUS
 SURVEY,
 WE HAD
 SECURED
 THE
 ALARM
 SYSTEM,
 AND
 THEN
 MY GAZE
 MOST
 UNEXPECTEDLY
 FELL
 UPON
 A REPRODUCTION
 OF THE
 "SECRET
 SUPPER"
 - THE
 EPIC
 WORK
 OF THE
 LEGENDARY
 LEONARDO
 DA VINCI
 HUNG ON ONE
 OF THE
 SIDE
 STAIRCASES
 OF THE
 FORMER
 RESIDENCE
 OF THE
 FELISTER
 - IT WAS
 COMMON
 KNOWLEDGE
 THAT
 THIS
 PAINTING
 WAS
 FULL
 OF CODES
 AND
 SYMBOLISM,
 AND
 WHAT
 BETTER
 PLACE
 THAN
 TO PICK
 UP A TRAIL
 TO FOLLOW. 

WHO
 WAS
 BETRAYING
 JESUS?
 WHO
 WANTED
 TO TAKE
 HIS
 PLACE?
 HE WHO
 WAS
 MOST
 TRUSTED.
 I LOOKED
 INTO
 THE
 EYES OF JUDAS...
 PERHAPS
 THEREIN
 LAY
 THE
 ANSWER. 

COME
 TO THINK
 OF IT,
 ABSOLUTELY
 NO ONE
 SURVIVED
 THE
 RAID
 EXCEPT
 ME, BUT
 THEN
 AGAIN,
 AS WE SAID,
 RAUL
 WAS
 EXECUTED
 A LITTLE
 EARLY.
 SO STRANGE... 
FATHER
 TOBIAS
 SUDDENLY
 CALLED
 - WE'D
 BOUGHT
 AN ENCRYPTED
 PHONE
 THAT
 WAS
 HARDER
 TO TRACE,
 BUT WE'D
 SOON
 BE RID
 OF IT,
 AND
 THE
 ROCKERS
 HADN'T
 CONFISCATED
 IT IN THE
 SEARCH
 OF ZONARA
'S BAG.
 I MAY
 HAVE
 NEGLECTED
 TO MENTION
 THAT
 ARLO
 WAS
 FUNDING
 OUR
 ONWARD
 JOURNEY
 WITH
 THE
 LITTLE
 MONEY
 HE HAD
 LEFT
 FROM
 SELLING
 THE
 WEED. 
HE INFORMED
 US THAT
 THE
 FELISTER
 CODE
 WAS
 HIDDEN
 IN SOME
 PICTURE
 - HE HAD
 CRACKED
 SOME
 OF DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN'S
 DOCUMENTS
 - AND
 THE
 249 
 ASSUMPTION
 THAT
 WE HAD
 TO GO ON THE
 TRAIL
 OF THE
 REAL
 TRAITOR
 WAS
 JUSTIFIED. 
RAOUL
 WAS
 IN CHARGE
 OF THE
 DISTRIBUTION
 OF THE
 PIGS
 - IT MAY
 SOUND
 FUNNY,
 BUT
 THE
 DESIGNATED
 BATCHES
 WENT
 BY THEIR
 RESPECTIVE
 DIFFERENT
 ROUTES,
 WHICH
 FURTHER
 CONFUSED
 THE
 AUTHORITIES,
 AND
 FELISTER
 WAS
 A MANIAC
 ABOUT
 USING
 CODES
 - EACH
 BATCH
 HAD
 ITS
 OWN,
 AND THE
 COMBINATIONS
 WERE
 CONSTANTLY
 CHANGING.
 THIS
 INNOVATION
 APPEALED
 TO HIM
 AS IT CREATED
 MUCH
 GREATER
 OPPORTUNITIES
 FOR
 FLEXIBILITY. 
RAUL
 WAS
 A POOR
 MEXICAN
 BOY,
 BORN
 IN GUADALAJARA
 MEXICO,
 WHO
 HAD
 BEEN
 ADOPTED
 BY FOSTER
 PARENTS
 AND
 TURNED
 INTO
 A NATURALIZED
 AMERICAN,
 AND FELISTER
 HAD
 TAKEN
 HIM
 IN,
 BUT HE HAD
 TURNED
 OUT
 TO BE THE
 DRUG CARTELS'
 HIDDEN
 MOLE
 - ZONARA
 WAS
 OPERATING
 FROM
 MEXICAN
 SOIL
 AND
 RAUL
 FROM
 AMERICAN
 SOIL.
 FELISTER
 WOULD
 HARDLY
 HAVE
 SUSPECTED
 HIM
 UNDER
 THE
 CIRCUMSTANCES. 
WHEN
 RAUL
 HAD
 BEEN
 LEFT
 WITHOUT
 AN ARM,
 FELISTER
 HAD
 NEARLY
 SHED
 A TEAR
 - NOT
 FROM
 PITY,
 BUT FROM
 THE
 FACT
 THAT
 HE WAS
 LOSING
 A VALUABLE
 SHOT. 

DURING
 HIS
 LIFETIME,
 RAUL
 HAD
 EXECUTED
 SOME
 UNRULY
 FARM
 SERVANTS,
 STRANGLING
 THEM
 WITH
 HIS
 BARE
 HANDS
 AS THEIR
 LIVES
 SLOWLY
 LEFT
 THEM
 - ALTHOUGH
 SUCH
 AN ACT
 WAS
 BRUTAL
 TO SAY
 THE
 LEAST,
 IT HAD
 RESULTED
 IN A LIFTING
 OF DISCIPLINE
 WITHIN
 THE
 TROOP
 AND
 HAD
 NOT
 GONE
 UNNOTICED
 BY THE
 EXPERIENCED
 EYE OF THE
 BREEDER. 
WE HAD
 ASSUMED
 THAT
 FINGERPRINT
 POWDER
 COULD
 BE USED,
 AND
 USED,
 TO UNCOVER
 RELEVANT
 ONES
 - AND
 THE
 RESULT
 WAS
 NOT
 LONG
 IN COMING.
 MECHANICAL
 STAINING
 SOON
 REVEALED
 THE
 TYPICAL
 250 
 PAPILLARY
 PATTERNS
 ON THE
 FINGER
 PADS
 - APPARENTLY
 THE
 PRINTS
 WERE
 LEFT
 SOON.
 WE WERE
 ABLE
 TO GET
 A FAIRLY
 CLEAR
 SPECIMEN
 FROM A THUMB
 - ONCE
 WE HAD
 IT, WE COULD
 SEND
 IT TO FATHER
 TOBIAS,
 WHO
 HAD
 SECRETLY
 TAKEN
 IT UPON
 HIMSELF
 TO HELP
 US,
 SO THAT
 HE COULD
 FORWARD
 IT FOR ANALYSIS. 
WE COULDN'T
 STAY
 TOO LONG
 IN THE
 HOUSE,
 AS WE WERE
 ALREADY
 DELAYED
 ENOUGH
 - I DIDN'T
 CLAIM
 TO BE COUNTING
 THE
 MINUTES,
 BUT
 I THINK
 WE WERE
 HERE
 FOR ABOUT
 A QUARTER
 OF AN HOUR,
 WHICH
 POSED
 DANGERS. 

I DIDN'T
 NOTICE
 ANY
 EQUIPMENT
 RECORDING,
 WHICH
 SURPRISED
 ME,
 BUT
 WE WERE
 WEARING
 MASKS
 AND
 GLOVES
 - JUST
 IN CASE. 
THEN
 WE HAD
 TO SPEND
 A LONG
 AND
 NOT
 VERY
 PLEASANT
 EVENING
 IN THE
 FIELDS
 AROUND
 KAMLOOPS.
 TO BE PERFECTLY
 FRANK,
 EVERYWHERE
 I WENT
 I STILL
 FELT
 ON FOREIGN
 SOIL.
 FATHER
 TOBIAS'S
 CALL
 WAS
 NOT
 LONG
 IN COMING,
 AND
 HE INFORMED
 US THAT
 THE
 PRINT
 DID
 INDEED
 BELONG
 TO RAUL
 HERNANDEZ
 - AND
 THIS
 COINCIDENCE
 COULD
 NOT
 HAVE
 BEEN
 COINCIDENTAL. 
WHOEVER
 HAD
 TAKEN
 HIS
 SEVERED
 HAND
 TO DAGOS
 HIM
 (HERNANDEZ'S
 FINGERPRINT
 HAD
 BEEN
 PLACED
 RIGHT
 ON THE
 JEW'S
 FOREHEAD)
 AS A TRAITOR
 - AND
 IN THE
 HOUSE
 OF THE
 FELISTER
 HIMSELF,
 WAS
 PROBABLY
 AS MUCH
 IN THE
 LOOP
 AT LEAST
 AS WE
 WERE
 AS TO WHERE
 EVENTS
 WERE
 GOING. 
HENCEFORTH
 WE FELT
 HOPEFUL
 AND
 HEARTENED,
 AND
 RESOLVED
 TO MAKE
 THE
 BEST
 USE
 OF THE
 INFORMATION
 - AND
 THERE
 CERTAINLY
 WAS
 SOME
 - EVEN JUST
 GIVING
 HIS
 NAME
 TO SOME
 INTERESTED
 REPRESENTATIVE
 OF THE
 MEXICAN
 CARTELS
 COULD
 BRING
 US A HUGE
 UNOFFICIAL
 REWARD. 
251 
 - "SOME
 SAY
 THAT
 TIME
 ITSELF
 IS LOCKED
 UP IN THE
 SECRET
 DINNER!,"
 I MUTTERED. 
ZONARA
 AND
 ARLO
 LOOKED
 AT EACH
 OTHER
 STRANGELY. 

IT MEANT
 THAT
 SOMEONE
 HAD
 GIVEN
 FALSE
 TESTIMONY
 TO GATHER
 ENOUGH
 GROUNDS
 FOR
 THE
 RAID
 ON FELISTER.
 AND
 THEN,
 LIKE
 THE
 BUTTERFLY
 EFFECT,
 THE
 SMALL
 CHANGE
 HAD
 LED
 TO A WHOLE
 SERIES
 OF EVENTS
 UNPREDICTABLE
 AND
 ENORMOUS
 IN THEIR
 SCALE.
 AND
 THIS
 SOMEBODY
 MIGHT
 BE RUBBING
 PEANUTS
 IN SOME
 PRISON
 - IT REMAINED
 TO FIND
 HIM,
 OR AT LEAST
 TO FIND
 OUT
 WHO
 HE REAL
LY WAS 
THE
 CODE
 WHICH,
 ACCORDING
 TO FATHER
 TOBIAS,
 WAS
 HIDDEN
 IN THE
 PAINTING,
 WAS
 VERY
 TELLING
 IN THIS
 RESPECT.
 IT CONSISTED
 OF THE
 ROMAN
 NUMERALS
 - V III IX II,
 WHICH
 APPARENTLY
 HAD
 SOME
 MEANING
 TO THE
 INITIATED
 - BUT
 NOT
 TO US. 
WE RACKED
 OUR
 BRAINS
 FOR A LONG
 TIME
 AS TO WHAT
 THE
 NUMERALS
 MIGHT
 MEAN
 AND
 WHY
 THE
 FELISTER
 CODE
 WAS
 SPELLED
 OUT
 WITH
 THEM.
 THEN
 IT OCCURRED
 TO ME THAT
 MAYBE
 IT WAS
 THE
 ALTERED
 CODING
 OF ONE
 OF THE
 BATCHES
 OF DOPE,
 AND
 THAT
 WOULD
 LEAD
 US TO THE
 MAN
 WHO
 KNEW
 THAT
 RAUL
 HAD
 COMMITTED
 THE
 REAL
 BETRAYAL,
 AND
 SOME
 UNKNOWN
 FORCES
 HAD
 BEEN
 ACTIVATED
 THAT
 NIGHT
 AND
 HAD
 BROUGHT
 ABOUT
 THE
 DOWNFALL
 OF THE
 ENTIRE
 BREEDER
 EMPIRE. 
I TRIED
 TO SLEEP.
 I REMEMBERED
 THAT
 THE
 QUIETEST
 ROOM
 IN THE
 WORLD
 EXISTED
 IN THE
 US AND
 PEOPLE
 WENT
 MAD
 IF THEY
 STA
YED IN IT TOO
 LONG,
 AND
 THEY
 MIGHT
 EVEN DIE
 - I HONESTLY
 WISHED
 I WAS
 IN THAT
 ROOM
 AND
 THAT
 WOULD
 END
 MY EARTHLY
 TORMENTS
 BUT AS SOON
 AS I CLOSED
 MY EYES
 I WAS
 CLEARLY
 AWARE
 THAT
 I COULD
 SEE THE
 FLAMES
 AROUND
 THE
 252 
 FARM
 AND
 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT
 THEY
 WERE
 BIGGER
 THAN
 THE
 FLAMES
 OF HELL
 ITSELF. 
TRY
 AS I MIGHT,
 I COULD
 NOT
 SOLVE
 THE
 MYSTERY,
 WHICH
 GAVE
 NO HOPE
 AT ALL
 THAT
 OUR
 SEARCH
 WOULD
 END,
 BUT
 SOMETHING
 TOLD
 ME WE WERE
 CONTINUING
 IN THE
 RIGHT
 DIRECTION.
 I HADN'T
 EXPECTED
 IT TO BE ALL
 TOO
 EASY
 - APPARENTLY
 FELISTER
'S SIMPLE
 LIFE
 PHILOSOPHY
 THAT
 PIGS
 ARE
 MULTI-LAYERED
 ANIMALS
 HAD
 BORNE
 FRUIT. 
AND
 WHAT
 WAS
 MULTIPLICITY?
 PERHAPS
 A WELL-
CONSTRUCTED
 INTERPLAY
 BETWEEN
 DIFFERENT
 SPHERES
 OF EXISTENCE
 BASED
 ON SUFFERING
 OR PERHAPS
 CONFESSION. 
I PONDERED
 THE
 STRANGE
 COMBINATION
 OF FELISTER
 - THE
 NUMBERS
 REVERSED
 INTO
 EUROPEAN
 DIGITS
 WERE
 5, 3, 9, 2. WHAT
 WAS
 THEIR
 HIDDEN
 MEANING?
 WHERE
 WAS
 THE
 CRUEL
 PIGMAN'S
 MADNESS
 LEADING...? 

THE
 MORE
 I WENT
 INTO
 HIS
 SICK
 AMBITIONS,
 I FELT
 THAT
 THE
 MOST
 TERRIB
LE THING
 WAS
 COMING,
 AND
 IT WOULD
 HAPPEN
 IN ONE
 FORM
 OR ANOTHER
 WITH
 OR WITHOUT
 OUR
 PARTICIPATION.
 THE
 CIRCLE
 WAS
 NARROWING. 

THE
 CONCEPT
 OF THE
 CIRCLE
 WAS
 INTERESTING,
 BUT
 FELISTER
 HAD
 CALCULATED
 THINGS
 TO AN UNUSUAL
 DEPTH. 

WE CONTINUED
 TO UNRAVEL
 THE
 MYSTERY,
 WHICH
 WAS
 BECOMING
 INCREASINGLY
 OBSCURE. 
THAT
 THREAD
 WITH
 THE
 FEDERAL
 AGENTS
 HAD ESCAPED
 MY MIND.
 BACK
 IN HOOVER'S
 TIME
41, THEY
 WERE
 TRAINING
 REAL
 GEEKS,
 AND
 THEIR
 TRAINING
 IN                                                
 41 Hoover is the most successful FBI director in the Unit
ed 
States. 
253 
 CRIMINOLOGY
 AND
 CRIMINAL
 JUSTICE
 WAS
 PROVERBIAL.
 BUT
 MORE
 ON THAT
 LATER. 
WE HAD
 TO FIGURE
 OUT
 HOW
 TO GET
 TO THE
 MYSTERIOUS
 PRISONER
 WHO
 HAD
 ACTUALLY
 GOTTEN
 THE
 INFORMATION
 BEFORE
 WE DID
 - AND
 ESPECIALLY
 WHO
 IT WAS
 WHO
 HAD
 GIVEN
 IT TO HIM. 
WE CONTINUED
 WITH
 OUR
 INVESTIGATIONS
 AND
 CAME
 TO A SECRET
 ROOM
 IN FELISTER
'S HOUSE
 WHERE
 THERE
 WAS
 A SMALL
 SAFE,
 AND
 THERE
 ON A NOTE
 WAS
 THE
 FOLLOWING
 MESSAGE: 
 "YOUR
 BROTHER
 - DIEGO.
 I KNOW
 EVERYTHING.
 WHO
 IS HE?
 THE
 ROAD
 IS OVER,
 AND
 WE ARE ..." IF YOU
 TOOK
 THE
 ORDER
 OF THE
 WORDS
 IN THE
 MESSAGE,
 IT GENERALLY
 CAME
 OUT
 LIKE
 THIS
 - "EVERYTHING
 IS OVER
 DIEGO,
 BROTHER." 
APPARENTLY
 THE
 SECRET
 ENTITY
 WAS
 MAKING
 ACCUSATIONS
 AGAINST
 THE
 REAL
 PERPETRATOR,
 BUT
 THEN
 RAUL
 WAS
 INNOCENT
 OF THAT
 CHARGE.
 HOWEVER,
 THERE
 WAS
 LOGIC IN ANOTHER.
 RAUL
 KNEW
 HE COULDN'T
 BETRAY
 THE
 FELISTER
 DIRECTLY,
 AND
 HE NEEDED
 SOMEONE
 TO LIAISE
 WITH
 THE
 DRUG CARTELS
 - SOMEONE
 OTHER
 THAN
 ZONARA,
 WHO
 WAS
 MORE
 THE
 MAIN
 PERSON
 DIRECTING
 THE
 ATTACKS
 ON THE
 BREEDER
 - HE NEEDED
 A MOLE
 INFORMANT. 
WELL
 ... IF IT WAS
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN'S
 SON
 ... IT MADE
 SENSE
 ... THE
 YOUNG
 YUPPIE
 HAD
 MADE
 HIS
 MON
EY FROM
 HIS
 SUPPOSED
 LEGAL
 CAREER
 AND
 HAD
 AGREED
 TO DRIVE
 US EVERYWHERE
 IN THE
 NAME
 OF AN OCCULT
 RITUAL
 - ONE
 HAD
 TO GUESS
 THAT
 THERE
 WERE
 OTHER
 ULTERIOR
 MOTIVES
 IN HIS
 INTENTIONS.
 BUT
 HE WAS
 DEAD,
 AND
 NO ATTEMPT
 COULD
 BE MADE
 TO MAKE
 ANY
 SORT
 OF PLEA
 AGAINST
 THESE
 CHARGES. 
254 
 JAKE
 WAS
 HIS
 REAL
 NAME,
 BUT
 WAS
 IT POSSIBLE
 THAT
 HE HAD
 BEEN
 ADOPTED
 BY THE
 DETECTIVE? 
WE DUG AROUND
 THROUGH
 A SPECIAL
 INFORMANT
 WHO
 TOLD US THAT
 INDEED
 JAKE
 HAD
 BEEN
 SUBJECTED
 TO A SIMILAR
 PROCEDURE
 - AND
 BY THE
 FELISTER
 HIMSELF
 ONLY
 THAT THERE
 HAD
 BEEN
 A MIX-
UP IN NAMES
 AND
 THEY
 HAD
 SIMPLY
 NAMED
 HIM
 DIEGO
 - THAT
 NAME
 WAS
 BEFITTING
 A MEXICAN
 AND
 JAKE
 WAS
 MORE
 ANGLO-SAXON. 
DIDN'T
 FELISTER
 HAVE
 A REAL
 BABY
 FACTORY?
 BY THAT
 LOGIC,
 THE
 SECRET
 SURVIVOR
 WAS
 CONNECTED
 TO FELISTER
'S FARM,
 OR AT LEAST
 COULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 AN EMPLOYEE
 OR ... 
THERE
 WAS
 SOMETHING
 I REMEMBERED
 - THE
 WAY
 FELISTER
 SWITCHED
 THOSE
 WHO
 WERE
 IN THE
 PROCESS
 OF ADOPTION
 - UNDER
 STATE
 LAW
 SOME
 ASPECTS
 OF THE
 PROCESS
 COULD
 BE ONEROUS
 - AND
 YET
 THERE
 WERE
 LOOPHOLES
 FOR
 ADOPTION
 TO BE DENIED
 - THAT'S
 WHAT
 HE HAD
 DONE,
 AS WE'VE
 ALREADY
 SAID,
 WITH
 MILES.
 AND
 IF THERE
 WAS
 ONE
 OTHER
 ADOPTEE
 - BESIDES
 ME,
 HOW
 HAD
 I NOT
 NOTICED
 IT ALL
 THESE
 YEARS
 - IT WAS
 REAL
 MADNESS!
 MAYBE
 HE'D
 JUST
 STAYED
 HIDDEN
 AND
 GUARDED
 IN CASE
 OF NEED
 - OR WORKED
 IN THE
 DUNGEONS
 - WHERE
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 HAD
 WALKED
 AROUND
 TO INSPECT
 THE
 REMAINS
 OF THE
 DRUG LAB
 WITH
 THE
 FENTANYL
 ADDITIVES
 IN THE
 OPIATE,
 OR PROTECTED
 HIS
 INTERESTS
 IN SOME
 OTHER
 WAY. 
A QUOTE
 FROM
 SCRIPTURE
 POPPED
 INTO
 MY MIND
 THAT
 READ
 "THE
 SPIRIT
 CLEARLY
 SPEAKS
 THAT
 IN THE
 LAST
 TIMES
 SOME
 WILL
 DEPART
 FROM
 THE
 FAITH,
 BEING
 LED
 BY DECEIVING
 SPIRITS
 AND
 DOCTRINES
 OF DEMONS.
42" 
                                               
 42   Timothy 4:1 
255 
 APPARENTLY
 FELISTER
 HAD
 SET UP AN ELABORATE
 ADOPTION
 SYSTEM
 THAT
 OPERATED
 ON A HELLISHLY
 DECEPTIVE
 PRINCIPLE
 - AND
 HOW
 IT WAS
 POSSIBLE
 THAT
 THIS
 SERIOUS
 FACT
 HAD
 ESCAPED
 MY NOTICE.
 THE
 HIERARCHY
 ON FELISTER
'S FARM
 WAS,
 ABOVE
 AND
 BELOW,
 AS FOLLOWS:
 FELISTER,
 RAOUL,
 MYSELF
 - ELIZANDER
 BARNAYNE,
 AND
 THE
 REST
 ...
 THE
 WHOLE
 GAGGLE
 OF CRIMINALS,
 RECIDIVISTS
 AND
 PSYCHOPATHS
 WHO
 GOT THEIR
 LIVING
 BY PARTICIPATING
 IN THE
 CRIMINAL
 SCHEME. 
BUT HOW
 THE
 COMPLICATED
 ADOPTI
ON RELATIONSHIP
 HAD
 COME
 ABOUT
 - APPARENTLY
 JAKE
 OR DIEGO
 OR WHATEVER
 HIS
 REAL
 NAME
 WAS
 HAD
 BEEN
 INFILTRATED
 WITH
 FELISTER,
 BUT
 IN THE
 END
 HE WAS
 JUST
 PROTECTING
 HIS
 CORPORATE
 INTERESTS.
 HOWEVER,
 HOW
 WAS
 AN INVESTIGATION
 NOT
 RAISED
 IN SUCH
 A CASE? 
HIS
 DELICATE
 POSITION
 AS AN ADOPTED
 CHILD
 OF DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 AND
 HIS
 FORMAL
 RE-ADOPTION
 - NOW
 AS AN ADULT
 - BY FELISTER
 GAVE
 HIM
 THE
 ENORMOUS
 ADVANTAGE
 OF A MAN
 STANDING
 ON TWO
 'FEET'.
 AND
 WHY
 HAD
 HE BETRAYED
 HIS
 BENEFACTOR?
 VERY
 SIMPLY
 - BECAUSE
 BY NATURE
 HE BELONGED
 TO NEITHER.
 BUT
 THERE
 WAS
 ALSO
 SOMETHING
 STRANGE-
WHY,
 IF THIS
 SOMEBODY
 KNEW
 OF THE
 TRAITOR
 DIEGO'S
 SORDID
 AFFAIR,
 HAD
 HE NOT
 INTERROGATED
 HIM
 BEFORE
 US,
 OR ... 
I REMEMBERED
 THAT
 JAKE'S
 FORTUNE
 WAS
 NO MORE
 THAN
 TWO
 MILLION
 AND
 SOMETHING,
 BUT
 IT WAS
 QUITE
 POSSIBLE
 THAT
 THE
 REAL
 AMOUNT
 OF HIS
 WEALTH
 WAS
 MUCH
 GREATER.
 AND
 THAT
 WAS
 MOST
 LIKELY
 FELISTER
'S TRUE
 INHERITANCE.
 AND
 MAY-
MY LOGIC
 PROVED
 CORRECT
 ... 
EVEN THE
 DETECTIVE'S
 BEHAVIOR
 AT LA POINTE
 CEMETERY
 CONFIRMED
 IT - IT WASN'T
 SOMETHING
 THAT
 256 
 ESCAPED
 MY ATTENTION.
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 WAS
 HANGING
 BETWEEN
 THE
 GRAVES,
 BUT 
BUT THERE
 WERE
 THE
 FEDERAL
 AGENTS
 AGAIN
 ... WHETHER
 THEY
 WERE
 REAL
 OR ... GENERALLY,
 THESE
 AGENTS
 UNDERWENT
 SERIOUS
 TRAINING
 AND
 ACQUIRED
 EXTENSIVE
 SKILLS
 - SO IF THEY
 WEREN'T
 UP TO THE
 TASK,
 IT WAS
 PROBABLY
 SIMPLY
 BECAUSE
 THEIR
 REAL
 ASSIGNMENT
 WAS
 TO PROTECT
 SOMEONE
 - MAYBE
 THIS
 UNKNOWN
 PRISONER.
 AT THE
 TRAINING
 FACILITY,
 WHICH
 WAS
 LOCATED
 IN CUONTICO,
 THE
 TRAINING
 DIDN'T
 STOP.
 USUALLY,
 IN A SIMULATED
 SETTING,
 EVERYTHING
 WAS
 PLAYED
 OUT
 CAREFULLY.
 THE
 PROBLEM
 WAS
 THAT
 THIS
 TIME
 THE
 REAL
 SCENARIO
 WAS
 A LITTLE
 DIFFERENT.
 ONE
 PART
 WAS
 CONNECTED
 TO SOMETHING
 - SUPERNATURAL
 AND TOO
 SPECIAL.
 THAT
 SCENARIO
 SEEMED THE
 MOST
 LOGICAL
 TO ME, BUT
 IF IT WAS
 TRUE,
 I HONESTLY
 DIDN'T
 SEE
 HOW
 WE COULD
 GET
 THERE. 

WHETHER
 OR NOT
 IT WAS
 PLACED
 IN THE
 WITNESS
 PROTECTION
 PROGRAM,
 WHICH
 GENERALLY
 GUARANTEED
 A NEW
 LIFE AND
 A LOT OF POSSIBILITIES
 FOR EXISTENCE
 UNDER
 CERTAIN
 CONDITIONS
 UNDER
 GOVERNMENT
 PROTECTION
 AND
 FUNDING. 
THAT
 WOULD
 HAVE
 TAKEN
 US ... TO THE
 PRISONER
 HIMSELF,
 WHO
 WOULD
 HAVE
 TOLD US THE
 REST... 
THE
 SECRET
 WITNESS
 WAS
 TORTURING
 HIMSELF.
 IN THE
 DARKNESS
 OF HIS
 SOUL.
 PERHAPS
 HE WAS
 SEEKING
 RETRIBUTION!
 FORGOTTEN
 BY ALL!
 THE
 TRUE
 FORMLESS
 DARKNESS,
 FROM
 WHICH
 IT WAS
 QUITE
 POSSIBLE
 FOR
 ANYTHING
 TO CRAWL-THE
 SOURCE
 OF IMMEASURABLE
 TERROR.
 IT WAS
 AS IF THE
 SOUL
 WERE
 BEING
 BUFFETED
 BY THE
 WIND
 OF DEATH,
 AND
 ALL
 THIS
 HOPELESSNESS
 LED
 NOWHERE
 AND
 IT WAS
 LEADING
 TO THE
 FALSE
 HAPPINESS
 OF LIVING
 IN A FALSE
 257 
 REALITY!
 IT WAS
 AS IF HIS
 WORLD
 WAS
 CONNECTED
 TO A WELL
 INSULATED
 SILO...
 AND
 THE
 OUTSIDE
 WORLD
 WAS
 DEAD. 
USUALLY
 THE
 NAMES
 OF THOSE
 PUT
 ON THE
 PROGRAMME
 WERE
 INDEED
 DELETED
 AND
 CHANGED
 REPEATEDLY,
 SO THAT
 - EVEN IF WE CAME
 ACROSS
 IT,
 THERE
 WAS
 A REAL
 DANGER
 THAT
 WE WOULD
 GET
 WRONG
 INFORMATION
 AS TO ITS
 TRUE
 IDENTITY
 - UNLESS
 THE
 WITNESS
 IN QUESTION
 REVEALED
 HIMSELF
 AND
 ASKED
 TO COME
 INTO
 CONTACT
 WITH
 US. 
THERE
 WAS
 ALSO
 SOME
 DOUBT
 AS TO WHAT
 THE
 FEDS
 HAD
 BEEN
 LOOKING
 FOR
 JUST
 OFF
 THE
 RESERVATION,
 AND
 NO ARRESTS
 OR SOME
 OTHER
 OSTENTATIOUSNESS
 LIKE
 A SHOOTOUT
 ENSUED
 - PERHAPS
 THEIR
 INVESTIGATION
 HAD
 HIT
 A BUMP
 IN THE
 ROAD? 

INSIDE
 FELISTER
'S HOUSE,
 WHERE
 HE'D
 BURIED
 HIS
 SCARIEST
 SECRETS,
 I SENSED
 A VERY
 CLEAR
 NEGATIVE
 ENERGY.
 ZONARA
 AND
 ARLO
 COULDN'T
 TAKE
 IT TOO
 WELL,
 BUT
 THEY
 HAD
 TO PUT
 UP WITH
 THIS
 INCONVENIENCE.
 STILL,
 WE HAD
 GONE
 TOO FAR,
 AND
 PERHAPS
 ALL
 WOULD
 SOON
 BECOME
 CLEAR. 
AND
 THEN
 I HAD
 A VISION
 - I HAD
 SEEN THE
 SAME
 INITIALS
 THERE
 - FAR
 AWAY
 WHERE
 THOSE
 WHO
 HAD
 REACHED
 THE
 END
 HAD
 BEEN. 
AND
 WHERE
 WAS
 HE? 
IT WAS
 MOSTLY
 CONNECTED
 WITH
 THE
 SOUL
 OF FELISTER-
IT WAS
 A STRANGE
 MIXTURE
 OF LIGHT
 AND
 DARKNESS.
 AND
 WAS
 THERE
 LIGHT
 IN THE
 DARKNESS?
 AND
 DID
 THE
 LIGHT
 COME
 FROM
 THE
 GOOD
 ETHEREAL
 CREATURES? 

WE HAD
 LONG
 SINCE
 LEFT
 THE
 CONFINES
 OF KAMLOOPS,
 WHICH
 WAS
 NOT
 A PLACE
 TO WHICH
 I WOULD
 RETURN
 AGAIN
 IF I HAD
 THE
 CHANCE. WHEN
 WE 258 
 LEFT,
 I DIDN'T
 LOOK
 BACK.
 IT WAS
 MARCH
 AND THE
 TEMPERATURES
 OUTSIDE
 WERE
 FREEZING.
 BRITISH
 COLUMBIA
 CHARMED
 US WITH
 ITS
 RAW
 BEAUTY.
 WE WERE
 TRAVELLING
 ON THE
 TRANS-CANADA
 HIGHWAY,
 WHICH
 WAS
 ONE
 OF THE
 BEST
 WAYS
 TO CROSS
 THIS
 VAST
 COUNTRY
 EVER.
 IT WAS
 SEVERAL
 THOUSAND
 MILES
 LONG
 AND
 WE COULD
 SEE GLACIERS
 AND ALL
 KINDS
 OF BIZARRE
 SNOWSCAPES
 - EVEN SNOW-
CAPPED
 MOUNTAIN
 RIDGES
 IN THE
 DISTANCE.
 KAMLOOPS
 ALSO
 LAY
 ON THE
 TRANS-CANADA
 HIGHWAY,
 BUT LATER
 IT BRANCHED
 OFF IN TWO
 MAIN
 DIRECTIONS,
 AND
 WE HAD
 TO
 TAKE
 THE
 SOUTHERN
 OR NORTHERN
 ROUTE.
 WE DIVERTED
 ALONG
 THE
 SOUTHERN
 ONE
 TO ARRIVE
 WHERE
 WE NEEDED
 TO BE,
 IN THE
 ONTARIO
 TOWN
 OF MILTON.
 TRAFFIC
 WAS
 HEAVY
 AND
 WE COULD
 SEE ALL
 SORTS
 OF VEHICLES
 WEAVING
 THROUGH
 THE
 MANY
 LANES
 - LIKE
 A CATERPILLAR.
 IT WAS
 SO
 MONOTONOUS
 THAT
 ONE
 COULD
 EASILY
 FALL
 ASLEEP
 AND
 MISS
 SOMETHING
 REALLY
 IMPORTANT.
 AND
 DESPITE
 THE
 DECEPTIVE
 BEAUTY,
 I WAS
 ALERT. 
 
CHAPTER
 TWENTY-TWO:
 ON THE
 ROAD 
 
WE HITCHHIKED,
 BUT
 IN WINNIPEG,
 MANITOBA,
 WE HAD
 TO CHANGE
 OUR
 TRANSPORTATION
 TACTICS
 - OTHERWISE
 WE WOULD
 HAVE
 GOTTEN
 NOWHERE. 
AT A CAR
 DEALERSHIP,
 WE HAD
 SAVED
 A RICKETY
 CAMPER,
 AS THERE
 WAS
 NO OTHER
 WAY
 TO GET
 AROUND
 THE
 ENDLESS
 TERRITORIES
 OF THIS
 VAST
 COUNTRY.
 BOUGHT
 IT FOR ARLO,
 WHO
 REALLY
 LIKED
 IT.
 EVEN IN SUCH
 A BATTERED
 MODEL
 IT HAD
 THE
 STANDARD
 BATHROOM
 AND
 TOILET,
 A SMALL
 WARDROBE,
 A SMALL
 STOVE
 ON WHICH
 WE COULD
 COOK
 SOME
 MEALS,
 AND
 ALSO
 A SINGLE
 BED
 - WE 259 
 COULD
 MANAGE
 SOMEHOW.
 WE COULD
 TAKE
 TURNS
 SLEEPING
 ON IT WHILE
 THE
 OTHERS
 DROVE. 
THE
 SALESMAN'S
 NAME
 WAS
 ROGERS
 AND
 HE WAS
 A PRETTY
 GRIZZLED
 DUDE ABOUT
 TWENTY-FIVE,
 TWENTY-
SIX,
 TWENTY-SEVEN
 AT THE
 MOST.
 HE WAS
 SLATHERED
 LIKE
 THE
 WORLD
 WITH
 MACHINE
 GREASE
 AND
 HAD
 GASOLINE
 STAINS
 ON HIS
 COVERALLS.
 HE LOOKED
 LIKE
 A TROUBLED
 CHILD
 WHO
 HAD
 GOTTEN
 HIGH
 ON STRANGE
 SAUCES
 WHILE
 EATING
 LUNCH
 ON
 HIS
 LUNCH
 BREAK. 

HIS
 MOUSEY
 FACE
 STILL
 SHOWED
 SOME
 INTELLIGENCE,
 BUT IT WAS
 DULLED
 BY HIS
 GLASSY
 EYES. HE WAS
 IN HIS
 OWN
 LITTLE
 WORLD-SEPARATE
 FROM
 EVERYONE
 AND
 LONGING
 FOR A BREATH
 OF FRESH
 AIR. 
ROGERS
 WAS
 NOT
 ONE
 OF THOSE
 ANNOYING
 SALESMEN
 WHO
 BOTHERED
 HIS
 CUSTOMERS
 WITH
 SUPERFLUOUS
 CHATTER
 AND
 WASTED
 THEIR
 TIME
 WITH
 USELESS
 INFORMATION.
 HE QUICKLY
 ARRANGED
 THE
 PAPERWORK
 FOR THE
 CARAVAN,
 WHICH
 NEEDED
 A BIT
 OF BOLT
 TIGHTENING
 - SOMETHING
 HE DID
 DUTIFULLY
 AND
 ACTUALLY
 CAME
 IN AT THE
 PRICE
 OF THE
 WHOLE
 SERVICE.
 WE LOOKED
 AROUND
 - IT WASN'T
 TOO
 BAD.
 IT LOOKED,
 BY THE
 WAY,
 JUST
 LIKE
 ANY
 OTHER
 CAR
 WASH
 ANYWHERE
 IN THE
 WORLD,
 BUT
 THERE
 WAS
 A CERTAIN
 SYMBOLISM
 TO THIS
 ONE
 HERE
 - ROGERS
 WAS
 THE
 SOUL
 OF THIS
 PLACE
 AND
 GENERALLY
 EVEN OFFERED
 US A LITTLE
 MORE
 THAN
 WHAT
 WE HAD
 PAID
 FOR.
 GAVE
 US DIRECTIONS
 ON HOW
 TO GET
 TO ONTARIO
 AND
 SPECIFICALLY
 TO MILTON
 THE
 FASTEST.
 THERE
 WAS
 THE
 MAPLEHURST
 CORRECTIONAL
 CENTRE
 WHERE
 WE WERE
 LIKELY
 TO FIND
 OUR
 MAN.
 A LOT
 OF REPEAT
 OFFENDERS
 WERE
 LOCKED
 UP THERE,
 AND
 THE
 STORY
 SURROUNDING
 THE
 OPENING
 OF THE
 INSTITUTION
 ITSELF
 WAS
 QUITE
 INTERESTING.
 HOW
 HAD
 I GUESSED?
 WELL,
 THE
 FELISTER
 CODE
 WAS
 PRETTY
 TELLING
 IN THAT
 REGARD,
 BUT
 DETECTIVE
 LOGIC
 HELPED
 ME A LOT TOO
 - IT WAS
 MORE
 THAN
 CLEAR
 THAT
 FELISTER
 HADN'T
 260 
 GONE
 TO HEAVEN
 FOR ALL
 HIS DEEDS,
 AND
 WHAT
 BETTER
 BOOK
 WAS
 THERE
 THAN
 JOHN
 MILTON'S
 PARADISE
 LOST,
 HENCE
 I DECIDED
 TO END
 MY CHAOTIC
 IDEAS
 WITH
 THE
 ACTUAL
 CODE
 FOUND
 IN FELISTER
'S HOUSE
 IN CAMPLUPS,
 WHERE
 BY THE
 WAY
 WE FELT
 THE
 NEGATIVE
 ENERGY
 ALL
 TOO
 CLEARLY.
 CONVERTING
 IT - THAT
 IS,
 CHANGING
 THE
 ROMAN
 NUMERALS
 TO ARABIC
 - YIELDED
 THE
 NUMBER
 5392, WHICH
 SURELY
 MEANT
 SOMETHING
 MORE
 THAN
 JUST
 "IT'S
 ALL
 OVER
 DIEGO,
 BROTHER."
 PERHAPS
 INTERPRETING
 THIS
 ANGELIC
 NUMBER
 WOULD
 ALSO
 LEAD
 US TO THE
 NAME
 OF THE
 MYSTERIOUS
 PRISONER
 - I MEAN
 - HIS
 TRUE
 IDENTITY,
 AND
 WE'D
 LEARN
 A LITTLE
 MORE
 ABOUT
 WHAT
 KIND
 OF PERSON
 HE WAS.
 IT LOOKED
 LIKE
 SOME
 FORM
 OF SCRABBLE
 GAME
 TO ME, BUT
 I HAD
 TO SEE IF I COULD
 GET
 ANY
 NAME
 AT ALL
 OUT
 OF THE
 AVAILABLE
 LETTERS,
 OR AT LEAST
 SOMETHING
 MEANINGFUL.
 IN ENGLISH,
 YOU COULD
 GET
 A FEW
 MEANINGFUL
 LETTER
 COMBINATIONS
 THAT
 RESEMBLED
 WORDS
 OR SOMETHING.
 ONE
 OF THEM
 WAS
 "BORN
 T",
 WHERE
 BORN
 MEANT
 BORN,
 AND
 THE
 LETTER
 T HAD
 A MAGICAL
 MEANING.
 I DUG AROUND
 IN MY FAIRLY
 DECENT
 KNOWLEDGE
 OF MAGICAL
 ALPHABET
 AND
 RUNES,
 AND
 TAW
 OR TAV
43 WAS
 ASSOCIATED
 WITH
 THE
 WORD
 FOR TRUTH
 EMET,
 WHICH
 WAS
 IN HEBREW
 - YOU
 GET
 SOMETHING
 LIKE
 BORN
 TRUTH.
 EVEN IF THE
 COMBINATION
 WAS
 TRUE,
 IT DEFINITELY
 DIDN'T
 SPEAK
 TOO
 MUCH
 TO ME, BUT
 I FELT
 LIKE
 WE WOULD
 LEARN
 MORE
 SOON. 
THE
 ROAD
 WAS
 NOT
 WITHOUT
 ACCIDENTS.
 ROGERS
 HAD
 HELPED
 US - AND
 HELPED
 US A LOT.
 OTHERWISE
 WE WOULDN'T
 HAVE
 GOT WHERE
 WE WERE
 GOING
 AT ALL.
 I NOTICED
 HIS
 GRUBBY
 HANDS.
 HE MUST
 HAVE
 BEEN
 HUNGRY
 AND
 COLD.
 I FELT
 LIKE
 DOING
                                                
 43 The idea behind the word emet is that it includes t
he first, 
fourteenth, and twenty-eighth letters of the Hebrew a
lphabet, 
which in other words means that truth encompasses everyth
ing. 
261 
 SOMETHING
 GOOD
 FOR HIM
 AND
 LEFT
 HIM
 A SMALL
 PRESENT
 - A MODEST
 TIP.
 PERHAPS
 HE WAS
 GLAD
 LATER.
 BUT WE WERE
 STILL
 DRIVING
 A BRAHMA,
 WHICH,
 THOUGH
 TIGHT,
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 SURPRISED
 US IN THESE
 HARSH
 CONDITIONS. 
WE ALSO
 HAD
 SOME
 OTHER
 PLACES
 TO CROSS
 BEFORE
 WE REACHED
 MILTON. 
FOR THE
 FIRST
 TIME
 I WAS
 ABLE
 TO APPRECIATE
 SOMETHING
 EXTREMELY
 SPECIAL,
 AND
 IT WAS
 ROOTED
 IN THE
 DIFFERENCE
 BETWEEN
 THESE
 TWO
 COUNTRIES
 - THE
 US WAS
 THE
 ECONOMIC,
 POLITICAL,
 AND
 MILITARY
 CENTER,
 BUT
 CANADA
 HAD
 A STRONGER
 MIDDLE
 CLASS.
 AND
 IT WAS
 VISIBLE
 IN A RATHER
 UNOBTRUSIVE
 WAY. 

NEITHER
 ARLO
 NOR
 ZONARA
 GRUMBLED
 AT THE
 NEW
 CONDITIONS,
 AND
 WE TOOK
 THREE
 HOURS
 TO SLEEP,
 AND
 THEN
 WHOEVER
 HAD
 SLEPT
 TOOK
 THE
 WHEEL.
 I WOULDN'T
 SAY
 DRIVING
 WAS
 OUR
 STRONG
 SUIT
 - ESPECIALLY
 NIGHT
 DRIVING.
 IT WAS
 GENERALLY
 MORE
 DANGEROUS
 THAN
 DAYTIME
 DRIVING,
 BUT
 WE DIDN'T
 HAVE
 THE
 LUXURY
 OF WASTING
 TIME.
 WE STILL
 HAD
 A LOT
 OF ROAD. 
AND
 WHERE
 WAS
 THE
 ALMIGHTY
 ON THIS
 DREADED
 NIGHT
 IN WHICH
 WE WERE
 HEADED
 FOR THE
 NEXT
 LEVEL
 OF REALITY
 REVELATION?
 IF OUR
 SOULS,
 IF WE HAD
 ANY
 LEFT,
 HAD
 NO PULL
 TO ANYTHING,
 WHAT
 WAS
 THE
 POINT
 OF ENDURING
 IT?
 BUT
 WAS
 IT POSSIBLE
 THAT
 THE
 PAIN
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 REVEALED
 TO US WIDER
 LIMITS
 OF PERCEPTION
 AND
 SENSATION
 OF SO-CALLED
 SUBTLE
 REALITY?
 I KNEW
 THAT
 THE
 EPICUREAN
 THEORY
 OF HAPPINESS
 FOCUSED
 ON THE
 ABSENCE
 OF PAIN
 AND
 SUFFERING,
 BUT
 IN MY OPINION,
 ANYONE
 WHO
 DIDN'T
 FEEL
 IT-OR PRETENDED
 IT DIDN'T
 EXIST-EITHER
 DIDN'T
 BELONG
 IN THIS
 WORLD
 OR WAS
 A COMPLETE
 IDIOT. 
262 
 NONE
 OF US WERE
 SO EXPERIENCED
 AT DRIVING
 AS TO BE AWARE
 OF EXACTLY
 HOW
 TO USE
 THE
 LOW AND
 HIGH
 BEAMS
 - ESPECIALLY
 IN EXTREME
 CONDITIONS
 LIKE
 THESE,
 SO WE TRIED
 TO BE CAREFUL
 IN THIS
 REGARD
 LEST
 WE ACCIDENTALLY
 MISLEAD
 ONE
 OF THE
 OTHER
 DRIVERS
 AND
 CAUSE
 AN ACCIDENT.
 THERE
 WAS
 A HAILSTORM
 THAT
 WAS
 MAKING
 OUR
 MOVEMENT
 EVEN
 MORE
 DIFFICULT. 
IT HAD
 BEEN
 TOO
 LONG
 SINCE
 WE'D
 LEFT
 WINNIPEG
 BEHIND
 AND
 THE
 KINDLY
 ROGERS'
 FACE
 HAD
 ALMOST
 BEGUN
 TO FADE
 IN MY MIND
 - WE HAD
 TO MAKE
 A PLAN
 FOR LATER.
 WHEN
 WE REACHED
 THUNDER
 BAY,
 WE DEFINITELY
 NEEDED
 A LITTLE BREAK
 TO SOBER
 US UP - AFTER
 THE
 INDESCRIBABLE
 SNOW
 HELL
 ON THE
 MAIN
 HIGHWAY.
 THE
 SPEED LIMIT
 ON THE
 HIGHWAY
 ALSO
 MADE
 THINGS
 RATHER
 PECULIAR
 - WE COULDN'T
 EXCEED
 A HUNDRED
 KILOMETERS
 PER HOUR,
 BUT
 WE WERE
 ALSO
 GOING
 MUCH
 SLOWER
 A GOOD DEAL
 OF THE
 TIME. 
IN TOUNDER
 BAY
 WE STAYED
 IN A SMALL
 MOTEL
 AND
 I LAID
 OUT
 MY CONCERNS
 TO ARLO
 AND
 ZONE
R: - IF HE HAD
 BEEN
 PUT
 IN THE
 WITNESS
 PROTECTION
 PROGRAM,
 HE MIGHT
 NOT
 HAVE
 BEEN
 IN JAIL
 LONG
 AGO.
 AND
 WE MAY
 NEVER
 FIND
 HIM
 EITHER! 
THEY
 BOTH
 NODDED,
 BUT
 ZONARA
 ANSWERED
 ME QUITE
 CLEARLY: 
- SOMETHING
 TELLS
 ME THAT'S
 WHERE
 THE
 TRAIL
 IS.
 AND
 THIS
 TIME
 WE WILL GLIMPSE
 A GREAT
 DEAL
 OF THE
 TRUTH
 ABOUT
 FELISTER. 
WITH
 THAT,
 OUR
 CONVERSATION
 WAS
 FINALIZED
 AND
 THE
 THREE
 OF US WENT
 TO SLEEP.
 WE WERE
 EXTREMELY
 TIRED
 DUE TO THE
 INSANE
 DRIVING
 AND
 THE
 IMMENSE
 LACK
 OF SLEEP
 THAT
 HAD
 SAPPED
 OUR
 STRENGTH.
 BEFORE
 HEADING
 TO BED,
 HOWEVER,
 IN ADDITION
 TO SLEEPING
 IN SHIFTS
 TO RESORT
 TO SOME
 263 
 MORE
 SERIOUS
 MAGICAL
 PROTECTION
 SUCH
 AS BUILDING
 SOME
 SORT
 OF MAGICAL
 FIELD
 THROUGH
 THE
 SEAL
 OF SOLOMON.
 IT WAS
 PLACED
 ON A MOST
 ORDINARY
 RING
 OF SOLID
 GOLD
 THAT
 I WORE
 ON ONE
 OF THE
 FINGERS
 OF MY RIGHT
 HAND,
 AND WHICH
 COULD
 ALSO
 BE USED
 TO INVOKE
 SPIRITS
 - INCLUDING
 DEMONS.
 JUST
 IN CASE,
 I ALSO
 DREW
 A MAGIC
 CIRCLE,
 STARTING
 ACCORDING
 TO TRADITION
 FROM
 THE
 NORTH
 AND
 MOVING
 THE
 INDEX
 FINGER
 OF MY RIGHT
 HAND
 CLOCKWISE.
 USUALLY
 SOME
 SORT
 OF PHYSICAL
 TOOL
 WAS
 USED
 TO ACCOMPLISH
 THIS,
 BUT
 THE
 BASIC
 PRINCIPLE
 WAS
 TO CONSISTENTLY
 BUILD
 UP LARGE
 AMOUNTS
 OF ENERGY
 WITHIN
 THE
 CIRCLE
 TO DO THE
 REST,
 AND
 THE
 OTHER
 IMPORTANT
 ASPECT
 WAS
 PREVENTING
 NEGATIVE
 ENERGY
 FROM
 SEEPING
 IN,
 AS IT COULD
 WREAK
 HAVOC
 AND
 BREAK
 DOWN
 ITS
 EFFECTIVE
 DEFENSES.
 WITH
 THAT,
 THE
 OPENING
 OF THE
 MAGIC
 CIRCLE
 WAS
 COMPLETE.
 I DECIDED
 THERE
 WAS
 NO POINT
 IN OVERDOING
 IT AND
 LEFT
 MYSELF
 IN THE
 HANDS
 OF SLEEP. 
HOW
 MUCH
 WOULD
 IT COST
 TO FIND
 THE
 ONE
 WHO
 COULD
 TELL
 US THE
 WHOLE
 TRUTH
 ABO
UT THE
 MAIN
 VILLAIN,
 WHO
 ALSO
 HAPPENED
 TO BE MY BENEFACTOR.
 FOR THE
 FIRST
 TIME
 IN MY LIFE,
 I WONDERED
 IF GOOD AND
 EVIL
 WEREN'T
 JUST
 TWO
 SIDES
 OF THE
 SAME
 COIN
 - ONLY
 WE WERE
 LOOKING
 AT IT FROM
 THE
 WRONG
 SIDE
 AND
 IT WAS
 DISTORTING
 OUR
 PERCEPTIONS
 OF REALITY.
  IT IS REDUNDANT
 TO DESCRIBE
 THE
 DETAILS
 OF OUR
 ENTIRE
 JOURNEY,
 BUT
 I BEGAN
 TO REALIZE
 THAT
 THERE
 WERE
 ALSO
 MANY
 LOST
 SOULS
 IN THE
 SNOWY
 HELL
 OF CANADA
 WHO
 WERE
 MOST
 LIKELY
 SEEKING
 THEIR
 SALVATION. 

DURING
 THE
 REMAINING
 FEW
 HUNDRED
 MILES
 OF OUR
 JOURNEY,
 LITTLE
 OF NOTE
 HAPPENED. 
264 
 WE HAD
 TO CROSS
 THE
 REST
 OF THE
 TRANS-CANADA
 HIGHWAY-A
 DISTANCE
 OF SOME
 EIGHT
 HUNDRED
 AND
 SEVENTY
 MILES.
 THIS
 TOOK
 US SEVERAL
 DAYS,
 FOR
 OWING
 TO THE
 BAD
 WEATHER
 WE WERE
 MOVING
 LIKE
 TORTOISES. 

MILTON
 WAS
 IN THE
 ADMINISTRATIVE
 REGION
 OF HALTON,
 WHICH
 ITSELF
 WAS
 PART
 OF THE
 GREATER
 TORONTO
 AREA.
 WHEN
 WE ARRIVED,
 I REALIZED
 SOMETHING
 WAS
 WRONG
 - AND
 I WAS
 RIGHT.
 THE
 CITY
 WAS
 EXTREMELY
 PICTURESQUE
 AND
 IMPRESSIVE.
 AND
 ITS
 ATMOSPHERE
 WAS
 INCREDIBLE
 - THE
 MODERN
 SKYSCRAPERS
 STOOD
 OUT
 AGAINST
 THE
 CLASSICAL
 BUILDINGS
 IN THE
 BACK,
 STANDING
 OUT
 LIKE
 PROUD
 COLOSSI
 IN THE
 WINTER
 NIGHT
 - THEIR
 LIGHTS
 RESEMBLED
 SOME
 KIND
 OF WHIMSICAL
 FAIRYLAND,
 AND
 THE
 UNEMPLOYMENT
 RATES
 WERE
 EXTREMELY
 LOW.
 WE ARRIVED
 LATE
 IN THE
 EVENING
 OF MARCH
 TWENTY-SECOND
 VERSUS
 TWENTY-THIRD.
 IT WAS
 STILL
 BITTER
 COLD! 
THE
 MAPLEHURST
 CORRECTIONAL
 CENTER
 WASN'T
 TOO
 FAR
 AWAY
 EITHER,
 BUT
 WE DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO POKE
 AROUND.
  THE
 CLOSER
 WE GOT TO THE
 FINAL
 LEG
 OF OUR
 JOURNEY,
 THE
 MORE
 DOUBTS
 I HAD
 ABOUT
 FACING
 THE
 TRUTH.
 IT MADE
 ME KIND
 OF UNCOMFORTABLE
 TO HAVE
 TO ADMIT
 THAT
 WE COULD
 PROBABLY
 WITNESS
 STRANGE
 AND
 UNEXPLAINED
 TWISTS
 AND
 TURNS
 REGARDING
 WHAT
 WE ALREADY
 KNEW. 
IN THE
 ANCIENT
 TEACHINGS
 OF THE
 KABBALISTS
 - FOR FELISTER
 DEALT
 WITH
 ALL
 ASPECTS
 OF THIS
 ART,
 IT WAS
 SAID
 THAT
 THE
 FOUR
 PLANES
 OF THE
 UNIVERSE
 WERE
 ARCHETYPAL,
 SPIRITUAL,
 ASTRAL
 AND MATERIAL.
 AND
 A TRUE
 MAGICIAN
 HAD
 TO HANDLE
 ALL
 265 
 OF THEM
 WELL.
 IN THE
 SO-CALLED
 MALKUTH
44, THE
 ENERGIES
 OF THE
 HIGHER
 PLANES
 REACHED
 THE
 END
 POINT
 OF THEIR
 ROUTE
 AND
 ... I WANTED
 TO RECALL
 HOW
 IT ALL BEGAN
 - THE
 MOMENT
 I WORKED
 ON THE
 FARM
 OF A FELISTER,
 THE
 MOMENT
 I RESIDED
 IN THE
 BOARDING
 SCHOOL,
 AND
 BEFORE
 THAT
 ...? 
BUT THE
 BITING
 COLD
 INTERRUPTED
 MY MUSINGS.
 ARLO
 AND
 ZONARA
 WERE
 TOO
 DEDICATED
 AND
 KEPT
 FOLLOWING
 ME BECAUSE
 ALL
 THREE
 OF US PLAYED
 ON THE
 SAME
 "TEAM". 
IF ANYONE
 EVEN KNEW
 A FELISTER
 IN THIS
 TOWN,
 HARDLY
 THE
 SMARTEST
 THING
 WE COULD
 HAVE
 DONE
 WAS
 QUESTION
 ABOUT
 HIM
 LEFT
 AND
 RIGHT. 
IT WAS
 TOO
 COLD
 THAT
 NIGHT,
 SO WE DECIDED
 TO GO INTO
 A BREWPUB
 - WHERE
 WE COULD
 WARM
 UP A BIT.
 AND
 SOME
 POOR
 GUY
 WALKED
 PAST
 US - I WAS
 AMAZED.
 I EXPECTED
 HIM
 TO ASK
 US FOR SOMETHING
 ... 
THERE
 WAS
 SO MUCH
 SUFFERING
 ON EARTH!
 BUT HE PASSED
 INTO
 THE
 NIGHT
 AND
 DISAPPEARED. 
IN THE
 MORNING
 WE WERE
 AT MAPLEHURST,
 WHERE
 WE HOPED
 TO GET
 OUR
 QUESTIONS
 ANSWERED.
 TO SEE A PARTICULAR
 PRISONER
 ONE
 WENT
 THROUGH
 A DEFINITE
 PROCEDURE,
 AS DIFFERENT
 RECIDIVISTS
 WERE
 CONVICTED
 OF A VARIETY
 OF OFFENCES.
 INCIDENTALLY,
 THE
 LEVEL
 OF VIOLENCE
 IN SUCH
 A PRISON
 INSTITUTION
 WAS
 QUITE
 HIGH,
 AND
 THE
 HIGHEST
 IN THE
 PROVINCE
 OF ONTARIO
 - SO SOMETIMES
 THERE
 WAS
 TREMENDOUS
 PERVERSION
 GOING
 ON IN THE
 PRISON.
 SEEN FROM
 A BIRD'S
 EYE VIEW,
 THE
 PRISON
 WAS
 ENVELOPED
 IN GREENERY,
 AND
 THE
 NATIONAL
 FLAG
 FLEW
 PROUDLY
 OUT
 FRONT,
 BUT
 I GUESSED
 THAT
 INSIDE
 ATROCITIES
 WERE
 A DAILY
                                                
 44 According to ancient kabbalistic teachings, Malkuth is the 
tenth sephiroth of the tree of life. 
266 
 OCCURRENCE,
 AND
 THE
 "FURNISHINGS"
 IN THE
 CELLS
 WERE
 MORE
 THAN
 SPARTAN. 
WE DECIDED
 TO PRETEND
 TO BE HIS
 FRIENDS,
 BUT A LITTLE
 LATER
 IT WAS
 MADE
 CLEAR
 TO US THAT
 SUCH
 A MAN
 HAD
 NEVER
 EXISTED
 AND
 HAD
 NEVER
 BEEN
 HERE. 
BUT HOW
 WAS
 IT POSSIBLE? 
THE
 WARDENS
 AND
 SERVICE
 STAFF
 WERE
 ABSOLUTELY
 POLITE,
 BUT
 THEIR
 COOPERATION
 WAS
 TOO
 FORMAL
 FOR ME NOT
 TO HAVE
 CERTAIN
 DOUBTS
 - THEY
 WERE
 JUST
 EMPLOYEES
 OF THE
 SYSTEM.
 DUMB
 AND
 DEAF
 TO EVERYTHING. 

ON THE
 WAY
 BACK,
 WE HAD
 TO ADMIT
 THAT
 WE FOUND
 ABSOLUTELY
 NOTHING
 - IT WAS
 AS IF WE HAD
 JUST
 GOTTEN
 SOMEWHERE
 AND
 FROM
 THERE
 ON SOME
 INVISIBLE
 WALL
 PREVENTED
 US FROM
 CONTINUING
 - BUT THIS
 TIME
 I WONDERED
 WHAT
 NATURE
 IT WAS
 - WHETHER
 IT WAS
 ADMINISTRATIVE,
 MAGICAL,
 CRIMINAL,
 CORPORATE
 OR WHATEVER. 
 
CHAPTER
 TWENTY-THREE:
 THE
 STRANGER 
 
AFTER
 RETURNING
 TO MILTON
 AND
 VISITING
 THE
 SAME
 BREWERY
 FROM
 THE
 NIGHT
 BEFORE,
 A STRANGER
 APPROACHED
 US AND
 TOSSED
 ME A VERY
 SMALL
 SEALED
 ENVELOPE.
 IT WAS
 DOWNRIGHT
 TINY.
 STRANGE
 AS IT WAS
 I COULD
 NOT
 SEE
 HIS
 FACE
 NOR
 SMELL
 THE
 STRANGER'S
 SCENT. 
THE
 THREE
 OF US PRETENDED
 NOT
 TO
 CARE,
 BUT AS WE STEPPED
 OUTSIDE,
 OUR
 CURIOSITY
 GOT THE
 BETTER
 OF US.
 WE WERE
 CONSTANTLY
 ON THE
 LOOKOUT
 FOR A TAIL
 THAT
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 SPRUNG
 A SURPRISE. 
THE
 CONTENTS
 OF THE
 NOTE
 READ
 AS FOLLOWS: 
267 
 "YOU
 HAVE
 GONE
 TOO
 FAR.
 FROM
 NOW
 ON THE
 JOURNEY
 IS AT YOUR
 OWN
 RISK." 
THE
 NOTE
 CONTAINED
 NO OTHER
 INFORMATION
 AND
 WAS
 NEITHER
 HANDWRITTEN
 NOR
 PRINTED,
 BUT WAS
 ASSEMBLED
 FROM
 ASSORTED
 CLIPPINGS.
 I WAS
 ALSO
 SURE
 THAT
 THERE
 WERE
 NO FINGERPRINTS
 ON THE
 PAPER,
 AS THE
 STRANGER
 HAD
 EITHER
 PUT
 ON GLOVES
 OR SIMPLY
 APPLIED
 A SPECIAL
 GLUE
 TO "MASK"
 THE
 PAPILLARY
 LINES
 ON THE
 PADS
 OF HIS
 FINGERS
 AND
 PALM. 

I MADE
 A VERY
 BOLD
 CLAIM,
 THOUGH
 - WHAT
 IF WHOEVER
 HAD
 DIED
 WASN'T
 THE
 REAL
 JAKE,
 WHAT
 IF IT WAS
 SOMEONE
 COMPLETELY
 DIFFERENT
 - THE
 ONLY
 SURVIVOR
 OF THE
 RAID
 ON FELISTER
'S FARM
 - BESIDES
 MYSELF.
 THAT
 THEORY
 DIDN'T
 INSPIRE
 ANY
 CONFIDENCE
 IN ME,
 AND
 I SOON
 DISMISSED
 IT.
 JAKE
 WAS
 LYING
 SOMEWHERE
 IN LA POINTE
 CEMETERY
 - QUITE
 FAR
 FROM
 US,
 UNDER
 AT LEAST
 TWO
 FEET
 OF LOOSE
 EARTH
 - IF NOT
 MORE. 
I SHARED
 MY CONCERNS
 WITH
 ARLO
 AND
 ZONER
 - WHO
 KNOWS
 WHY
 I SEEMED
 TO HAVE
 BECOME
 MORE
 ACTIVE
 IN THE
 INVESTIGATION
 THAN
 THEY
 WERE. 
GOING
 BACK
 TO MILTON
 WAS
 COMPLETELY
 POINTLESS.
 THERE
 REMAINED
 THE
 POSSIBILITY
 OF GETTING
 TO THE
 MYSTERIOUS
 STRANGER
 WHO
 HAD
 HIMSELF
 GIVEN
 US THE
 NEXT
 TRAIL
 TO FOLLOW. 
AS WE WALKED
 THROUGH
 THE
 STREETS
 OF MILTON
 THE
 NIGHT
 BEFORE,
 THE
 FACES
 OF THE
 PEOPLE
 SEEMED
 SMILING,
 BUT
 SOMEHOW
 BLANK
 AND
 EXPRESSIONLESS
 - AS IF IT WERE
 ALL
 JUST
 A FALSE
 FACADE. 
THE
 CITY
 GOVERNMENT
 HARDLY
 FELT
 ANY
 REAL
 CONCERN
 FOR THAT
 HOMELESS
 MAN
 WE'D
 SEEN
 THE
 NIGHT
 BEFORE.
 THERE
 WAS,
 OF COURSE,
 A HOMELESS
 SHELTER
 IN MILTON
 - AS THERE
 IS EVERYWHERE,
 SO HE WOULD
 MOST
 LIKELY
 HAVE
 SPENT
 THE
 NIGHT
 EITHER
 268 
 THERE
 OR HIDDEN
 IN A BOX
 UNDER
 SOME
 STREET
 STAIRCASE,
 YAWNING
 AND
 CURSING
 HIS
 LIFE
 AWAY.
 A SOUL'S
 LONELINESS
 WASN'T
 DEFINED
 BY HOW
 MANY
 PEOPLE
 WERE
 AROUND,
 AND
 THIS
 POOR
 GUY
 DIDN'T
 ASK
 FOR ANYTHING
 FROM
 ANYONE
 - HE DIDN'T
 EVEN
 REACH
 OUT
 FOR
 A HANDOUT!
 HE QUIETLY
 DISAPPEARED...
 AS HE HAD
 APPEARED
 OUT
 OF NOWHERE!
 I COULDN'T
 EVEN SEE HIS
 FACE
 - IT WAS
 AS IF HE WAS
 INVISIBLE
 AND
 USELESS
 TO ANYONE! 
THE
 LETTER
 FROM
 THE
 MYSTERIOUS
 STRANGER
 MUST
 HAVE
 HAD
 SOME
 CODED
 MESSAGE
 IN IT AGAIN
 - AND
 I DECIDED
 TO USE
 THE
 SAME
 CODE
 WE HAD
 LEARNED
 AT THE
 FELISTER
 RESIDENCE
 - 5392. I STARTED
 LISTING
 THE
 POSSIBLE
 COMBINATIONS...
 NOTHING
 WAS
 WORKING
 - IT WAS
 TOO
 EASY
 FOR IT TO WORK.
 TOO
 OBVIOUS. 
HOWEVER,
 I DECIDED
 TO PLAY
 THE
 ELIMINATION
 METHOD
 - IF THE
 CIRCLE
 NARROWED,
 THE
 SECRET
 MEANING
 OF THE
 MESSAGE
 WOULD
 BE MORE
 SPECIFIC
 - NOT
 THAT
 IT WAS
 NECESSARY,
 BUT I DECIDED
 TO TRY
 THAT
 OPTION
 AS WELL. 
THE
 SECOND
 WORD
 OF THE
 SECRET
 MESSAGE
 WAS
 "BROTHER"
 AND
 IT CORRESPONDED
 TO THE
 LAST
 DIGIT
 OF THE
 CODE.
 THE
 ONLY
 ASSOCIATIONS
 THAT
 CAME
 TO MIND
 WERE
 BIG
 BROTHER.
 BUT
 AGAIN,
 THERE
 WAS
 SOME
 UNDERSTATEMENT
 AND
 MISCOMMUNICATION.
 I THINK
 THERE
 WAS
 SOMETHING
 MISSED
 AND
 WE HAD
 TO FIND
 IT. 
I ASKED
 ARLO
 AND
 ZONARA
 FOR THEIR
 OPINIONS
 - THEY
 WERE
 ALSO
 SILENT
 AND
 TRYING
 TO MAKE
 SOME
 KIND
 OF GUESS. 
THEN
 THE
 NEXT
 BOLD
 GUESS
 OCCURRED
 TO ME - BIG
 BROTHER
 - WELL
 YES 222 - THERE
 WERE
 TWO
 WORDS
 AND
 THEY
 BOTH
 STARTED
 WITH
 B IN LATIN,
 AND
 THAT
 269 
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 BEEN
 SOME
 ADDRESS
 OR PRISONER
 NUMBER. 

HERE
 WAS
 MY DETECTIVE
 LOGIC
 GIVING
 SOME
 ASSOCIATIONS
 AND
 PUSHING
 ME FORWARD
 ... INTO
 THE
 UNKNOWN. 

THE
 NEXT
 DAY
 WE WENT
 TO MAPLEHURST
 AGAIN
 - THIS
 TIME
 NOT
 EVEN
 ENTERING
 THE
 TOWN.
 WE
 ASKED
 TO SEE
 INMATE
 222'S
 FILE,
 BUT
 THIS
 TIME
 WE HAD
 PREPARED
 OURSELVES
 - WE HAD
 MORE
 THAN
 SIMPLE
 PLEAS
 AT OUR
 DISPOSAL
 - WE HAD
 LEGAL
 GROUNDS.
 ONE
 OF THE
 LAWYERS
 ADVISED
 US TO HIRE
 A PRIVATE
 INVESTIGATOR
 WHO
 HAD
 THE
 AUTHORITY
 TO REQUEST
 CERTAIN
 INFORMATION
 UNDER
 THE
 APPROPRIATE
 CHANNEL
 OF THE
 LAW.
 THIS
 PRODUCED
 GOOD
 RESULTS
 - NOT
 IMMEDIATELY,
 OF COURSE. 
IT TURNED
 OUT
 THAT
 THE
 ALLEGED
 INMATE,
 222, HAD
 NEVER
 SERVED
 HIS
 SENTENCE
 AT MAPLEHURST
 - OR,
 MORE
 ACCURATELY,
 HAD
 ONLY
 RESIDED
 THERE
 FOR ABOUT
 A WEEK
 BEFORE
 BEING
 PERMANENTLY
 TRANSFERRED
 TO A STATE
 PRISON.
 THIS
 TWIST
 SEEMED LIKE
 A ROLLER
 COASTER
 - I FELT
 LIKE
 WE COULDN'T
 LEAVE
 SOME
 WEIRD
 VICIOUS
 CIRCLE
 WHERE
 EVERYTHING
 WAS
 HAPPENING.
 BUT
 THE
 PRISON
 AUTHORITIES
 REFUSED
 TO GIVE
 US ANY
 MORE
 INFORMATION.
 ALL
 THEY
 SAID
 WAS
 THAT
 AS FAR
 AS THEY
 WERE
 INFORMED
 AFTER
 THAT
 HE HAD
 MADE
 A DEAL
 WITH
 THE
 FEDS
 AND
 FROM
 THEN
 ON WHAT
 HAD
 HAPPENED
 WAS
 A COMPLETE
 MYSTERY.
 OF COURSE,
 WE WEREN'T
 TOLD
 THE
 LATTER
 WITHOUT
 ZONARA
 USING
 ONE
 OF HER
 CONNECTIONS
 - CONGRESSMAN
 JOHNSTON,
 WHO
 WAS
 INDEBTED
 TO HER
 FOR FINANCING
 HIS
 ELECTION
 CAMPAIGN
 WITH
 THE
 UNIONS'
 DIRTY
 MONEY
 - AND
 IN PARTICULAR
 THROUGH
 ZONARA
'S ADVOCACY
 AS WELL
 AS THE
 SKILLFUL
 MANEUVERING
 OF DETECTIVE
 JASON
 SONDER,
 WHO
 INVOKED
 CERTAIN
 PROVISIONS
 IN THE
 LAW
 AND
 THREATENED
 MANAGEMENT
 INTO
 REFUSING
 TO 270 
 COOPERATE
 IN SOLVING
 THE
 CASE,
 WHICH
 IN TURN
 WITH
 A LITTLE
 LUCK
 COULD
 HAVE
 LED
 DIRECTLY
 TO A FEDERAL
 INVESTIGATION
 - THEY
 WERE
 SMART
 ENOUGH
 AND
 FIGURED
 IT WASN'T
 WORTH
 GETTING
 IN THAT
 MUCH
 TROUBLE
 OVER.
 DETECTIVE
 SAUNDERS
 HAD
 REFERRED
 TO CERTAIN
 PROVISIONS
 IN THE
 LAW 
- "MAYBE
 HE'S
 HERE
 IN CANADA
 WAITING
 FOR
 US AFTER
 ALL,"
 I BOLDLY
 CONCLUDED. 
ARLO
 MURMURED
 SOMEWHAT
 THOUGHTFULLY: 
- I'M
 CONVINCED
 WE HAVE
 TO GET
 TO HIM
 OURSELVES-
MAYBE
 HE'S
 EVEN CLOSE,
 OR MAYBE
 HE'S
 NOT. 
ZONARA
 DIDN'T
 TAKE
 ANY
 ATTITUDE
 - AT LEAST
 NOT
 WHILE
 WE WERE
 IN THE
 PRISON
 INSTITUTION.
 ONLY
 HER
 EYES LOOKED
 AT SOME
 INDETERMINATE
 POINT. 
I WAS
 ALREADY
 USED
 TO SOME
 OF THE
 "QUIRKS"
 OF MY COMPANIONS
 - MAYBE
 THAT'S
 WHY
 WE WORKED
 SO WELL
 AS A TEAM. 
BUT SOMETHING
 STILL
 URGED
 ME NOT
 TO TAKE
 ANYTHING
 FOR
 GRANTED
 AS THE
 SITUATION
 BECAME
 MORE
 AND
 MORE
 ENTANGLED.
 IT WASN'T
 AT ALL
 OBVIOUS
 WHO
 WAS
 HIDING
 BEHIND
 THE
 MASK
 OF ANONYMITY,
 WHILE
 AT THE
 SAME
 TIME
 PROMPTING
 US TO REVEAL
 HIS
 IDENTITY
 - AND
 WITH
 THE
 CONVICTION
 THAT
 HE KNEW
 THE
 REST
 OF THE
 PUZZLE. 
I WONDERED,
 HOWEVER,
 WHERE
 WE MIGHT
 CATCH
 THE
 CLUE
 THAT
 WOULD
 LEAD
 US TO HIM.
 MILTON
 WAS
 A SPECIAL
 PLACE
 WITH
 SPECIAL
 PEOPLE. 
AND
 AFTER
 THE
 INFORMATION
 DETECTIVE
 SAUNDERS
 HAD
 GIVEN
 US,
 WE NOW
 KNEW
 ENOUGH
 TO CONTINUE
 OUR
 JOURNEY
 ON OUR
 OWN.
 A JOURNEY
 TO THE
 INFINITE...OF
 THE
 HUMAN
 SOUL. 
FELISTER
 TAUGHT
 US THAT
 GROWING
 UP ON THE
 STREETS
 WOULD
 NOT
 BE SHAMEFUL
 UNLESS
 YOU
 271 
 LEARNED
 ITS LESSONS.
 IT WAS
 DOWN
 TO SURVIVAL.
 THE
 SPIRIT
 OF THE
 STREET
 WAS
 A UNIVERSE
 THAT
 WAS
 UNIQUE.
 AND
 PERHAPS
 THAT
 WAS
 EXACTLY
 WHAT
 THE
 STRANGER
 WANTED
 TO SUGGEST.
 AFTER
 ALL,
 EVEN THE
 APPARENT
 LACK
 OF LOGIC
 COULD
 BE EXPLAINED
 IN SOME
 FORM-SOONER
 OR LATER
 WE WERE
 GOING
 TO MEET-
EYE TO EYE. 
I TRIED
 TO MAKE
 SENSE
 OF WHETHER
 222 WAS
 AN ADDRESS
 OR SOMETHING
 ELSE
 - LIKE
 THE
 PRISONER'S
 OWN
 NUMBER.
 WHAT
 IF IT WAS
 MUCH
 SIMPLER
 AND
 ELEMENTARY? 

AT THE
 EXIT
 FROM
 MILTON
 WAS
 HIGHWAY
 FOUR,
 WHOSE
 NUMBER,
 DIVIDED
 IN TWO,
 GAVE
 THE
 SAME
 NUMBER,
 AND
 MAPLE
 AVENUE
 WAS
 DIRECTLY
 OPPOSITE
 IT,
 IT WAS
 THE
 SECOND
 WORD,
 WHICH
 MEANT
 A LARGE
 AVENUE,
 AND
 THE
 LAST
 TWO
 WAS
 PERHAPS
 THE
 HOUR
 AT WHICH
 WE WERE
 TO MEET-TWO
 AT NIGHT.
 WE DIDN'T
 HAVE
 A MAP
 HANDY,
 BUT WE LOOKED
 AT THE
 AREA
 ANYWAY,
 AND
 IT WAS
 EASY
 TO FIND
 - IT LOOKED
 LIKE
 THERE
 WAS
 SOME
 SORT
 OF WATERING
 HOLE
 IN THE
 AREA
 OR SOMETHING. 
I SHARED
 WITH
 ARLO
 AND
 ZONER
 ABOUT
 MY OBSERVATIONS
 - IT WAS
 A RELATIVELY
 SECLUDED
 SPOT
 WHERE
 WE COULD
 MEET
 - COMPLETELY
 UNDISTURBED
 AND
 TACKLE
 THE
 NEXT
 PART
 OF THE
 MYSTERY. 

THIS
 TIME
 THEY
 BOTH
 TURNED
 TO ME AND
 ASKED: 
- WHAT
 IF IT'S
 A TRAP?
 MAYBE
 HE PURPOSELY
 WANTS
 TO DESIGNATE
 A SIMILAR
 PLACE
 TO PULL
 THE
 STRINGS. 
I THOUGHT
 ABOUT
 IT AND
 CONCEDED
 THE
 RIGHTNESS
 OF THEIR
 ARGUMENT,
 BUT
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND
 THERE
 WAS
 NO OTHER
 ULTERIOR
 MOTIVE
 AND
 NO POINT
 IN BEING
 PUT
 THROUGH
 SO MANY
 HURDLES
 TO HAVE
 A TRAP
 SET
 FOR US RIGHT
 NOW. 
272 
 I REMEMBERED
 WELL
 THAT
 OLD
 TALE
 OF THE
 DREAM
 TRAP
45, WHERE
 EVIL
 SPIRITS
 WERE
 TRYING
 TO GET
 AT PEOPLE
 IN THEIR
 DREAMS,
 BUT THE
 WISE
 IKTOMI
 SPUN
 A WEB
 FOR THE
 TRIBE
 TO CATCH
 THE
 POSITIVE
 ENERGY.
 APPARENTLY
 THAT'S
 WHAT
 ARLO
 AND
 ZONARA
 WERE
 TRYING
 TO TELL
 ME.
 AFTER
 I QUESTIONED
 THEM,
 THEY
 NODDED
 AFFIRMATIVELY. 
IF ALL
 OF THIS
 WERE
 TRUE
 THE
 STRANGER
 WOULD
 BE WAITING
 FOR
 US RIGHT
 THERE
 AT EXACTLY
 TWO
 IN THE
 MORNING,
 BUT
 WOULD
 MOST
 LIKELY
 BE HARD
 TO SPOT. 
I DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO CRAWL
 AROUND
 THE
 AREA
 BECAUSE
 HE MIGHT
 HAVE
 SPOTTED
 US OR GUESSED
 OUR
 INTENTIONS.
 WE HAD
 ALREADY
 DECIDED
 TO SELL
 THE
 CAMPER
 BEFORE
 ENTERING
 MILTON,
 AS ALTHOUGH
 IT WAS
 COMFORTABLE,
 IT WAS
 RELATIVELY
 SLOW,
 AND
 WE NEEDED
 MORE
 MANEUVERABILITY. 
THE
 SYMBOLISM
 OF THE
 NIGHT,
 AND
 IN PARTICULAR
 THE
 NUMBER
 TWO,
 SUGGESTED
 TO ME SOME
 AMBIVALENCE.
 AT NIGHT
 THE
 EVIL
 FORCES
 WERE
 PARTICULARLY
 ACTIVE
 - SO AT THE
 APPOINTED
 TIME
 WE PREPARED
 AND
 WAITED
 - IN THIS
 PART
 OF THE
 CITY
 TRAFFIC
 WAS
 FAIRLY
 ACTIVE,
 BUT AT GREAT
 DISTANCES
 FROM
 US OF AT LEAST
 THREE
 HUNDRED
 YARDS
 NOT
 A LIVING
 PERSON
 COULD
 BE SEEN.
 THE
 SNOW
 CONTINUED
 TO PILE
 UP. 
AT SOME
 TIME,
 THE
 STRANGER
 APPEARED.
 I FELT
 HIS
 PRESENCE
 IN AN UNUSUAL
 WAY
 - SO STRANGE
 AND
 SUBTLE.
 THERE
 WAS
 NO DOUBT
 THAT
 HE WAS
 COMING
 TO TELL
 US AN IMPORTANT
 MESSAGE. 
HE WAS
 DRESS
ED IN SOME
 STYLISH
 BUT
 RATHER
 UNREMARKABLE
 GREY
 CLOTHES
 AND
 STEPPED
 VERY
 LIGHTLY.
 I COULD
 NOT
 YET
 SEE
 HIS
 FACE,
 BUT
 MY                                                
 45 This is a legend of the Lakota Indian tribe, which i
ncludes the 
Sioux and describes the life cycle of life. 
273 
 ATTENTION
 WAS
 ATTRACTED
 CHIEFLY
 BY THE
 FACT
 THAT,
 FOR SOME
 INEXPLICABLE
 REASON,
 HIS
 CLOTHES
 BLENDED
 IN WITH
 THE
 WHITE
 AND
 GREY
 SURROUNDINGS. 

WE WERE
 CLOSE
 TO THE
 ROAD
 THAT
 LED
 OUT
 OF MILTON
 AND
 INTO
 MISSISSAUGA,
 A CITY
 THAT
 OFFERED
 FAR
 MORE
 OPPORTUNITIES
 THAN
 MILTON
 AND
 WAS
 RIGHT
 NEXT
 TO THE
 HEART
 OF TORONTO
 ITSELF. 
IT STRUCK
 ME THAT
 THE
 STRANGER
 HAD
 EXCELLENT
 MANNERS
 AND
 SEEMED TO BE IN NO HURRY TO START
 THE
 CONVERSATION,
 AS HE WANTED
 TO LOOK
 US OVER
 BEFOREHAND.
 HE WAS
 COMPLETELY
 ALONE
 - CONTRARY
 TO MY EXPECTATION
 THAT
 HE WOULD
 BE BRINGING
 A WHOLE
 GANG
 OF GANGSTERS
 WITH
 HIM. 
AFTER
 THE
 INITIAL
 MUTUAL
 EXPLORATION,
 WE DECIDED
 TO CUT
 TO THE
 CHASE. THE
 STORY
 I HEARD
 FROM
 THE
 STRANGER
 EXCEEDED
 EVEN MY WILDEST
 EXPECTATIONS
 AND
 DEFINITELY
 LIVED
 UP TO ALL
 THE
 MISHAPS
 WE HAD
 BEEN
 THROUGH
 SO FAR.
 IT WAS
 EVEN MORE
 IMPRESSIVE
 THAN
 I ACTUALLY
 EXPECTED.
  "THEN
 THERE
 WAS
 AN INFORMER
 AFTER
 ALL,
 OR SOME
 HIDDEN
 TRUMP
 OF A FELISTER,
 AND
 MY REASONING
 WAS
 NOT
 WRONG
 IN THAT
 RESPECT!"
 THOUGHT
 I, LISTENING
 ATTENTIVELY
 TO THE
 STRANGER. 
FELISTER
 WAS
 A DOUBLE-BOTTOMED
 MAN
 AND
 ANYTHING
 COULD
 BE EXPECTED
 FROM
 HIM
 - THE
 VERY
 INTRICATELY
 WOVEN
 WEB
 OF MANIPULATION
 THAT
 WAS
 THE BASIS
 OF HIS
 BUSINESS
 SUCCESS
 AND
 HIS
 SHREWD
 BUSINESS
 MOVES
 WERE
 OBVIOUSLY
 TIED
 TO SOMETHING
 EXTREMELY
 DEEP. 
HE TOLD
 US THAT
 HE PREFERRED
 TO TALK
 IN SOME
 BETTER
 PROTECTED
 PLACE
 - AND
 WE ACCEPTED
 THIS
 CONDITION
 OF HIS.
 THIS
 TIME
 THE
 DRIVING
 WAS
 HANDLED
 BY
 ZONARA,
 WHO
 HAD
 BECOME
 MORE
 CONFIDENT
 IN THIS
 REGARD,
 AND
 ARLO
 KEPT
 A VERY
 274 
 CLOSE
 EYE OUT
 FOR
 ANY
 POSSIBLE
 TAIL
 AND
 ANY
 OTHER
 POSSIBLE
 THREATS.
 WE QUICKLY
 CLIMBED
 INTO
 THE
 CAR
 AND
 STARTED
 MAKING
 CONFUSING
 TURNS
 - THIS
 TACTIC
 WORKED
 FOR
 SOME
 AMATEURS,
 BUT
 SOMETIMES
 WELL-TRAINED
 ODOROLOGISTS
46 COULD
 USE
 VERY
 SPECIFIC
 TRACKING
 TECHNIQUES,
 AND
 A LITTLE
 LATER
 WE STOPPED
 ABOUT
 A MILE
 NORTH
 OF TOWN
 - YOU
 COULD
 TELL
 WE WERE
 UP IN THE
 MIDDLE
 OF NOWHERE,
 AND
 THE
 SNOW
 HID
 US FURTHER.
 AS A MATTER
 OF FACT,
 IN SUCH
 WEATH
ER CONDITIONS,
 WE HAD
 THE
 REAL
 POSSIBILITY
 OF GETTING
 HIM
 TO A SAFER
 PLACE
 THAN
 THIS
 - A RURAL
 BARN
 OR EVEN A TOOL
 STORAGE
 SHED,
 AS UNLIKE
 OTHER
 LOCATIONS
 SUCH
 AS NEARBY
 OAKVILLE,
 THE
 AREA
 AROUND
 MILTON
 WAS
 MORE
 OF A RURAL
 TYPE
 AND
 CONVENIENT
 PLACES
 FOR THIS PURPOSE
 WERE
 PLENTIFUL,
 BUT
 HERE
 THE
 SNOWDRIFT
 ACTED
 AS A MAGICAL
 SHROUD,
 HIDING
 US FROM
 EVIL
 EYES,
 AND
 I WANTED
 TO HEAR
 SOMETHING
 CONCRETE
 FROM
 THE
 STRANGER
 FIRST
 - AT LEAST
 A LITTLE,
 AND
 TO MAKE
 SURE
 DEFINITIVELY
 THAT
 WE WEREN'T
 ON THE
 WRONG
 TRAIL
 AND
 WASTING
 OUR
 TIME
 WITH
 HIM
 FOR NOTHING.
 IT TURNED
 OUT
 THAT
 HE WAS
 INDEED
 THE
 LATE
 RAUL'S
 BROTHER,
 AND
 BORE
 THE
 NAME
 OF DIEGO,
 WHILE
 THE
 OTHER
 - ADOPTED
 BY FELISTER,
 WHO
 HAD
 PREVIOUSLY
 BEEN
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN'S
 SON
 - WAS
 ALSO
 NAMED
 DIEGO
 - PURE
 COINCIDENCE.
 I DIDN'T
 THINK
 SO.
 AND
 I WAS
 RIGHT.
 RAUL
 HAD
 WITNESSED
 THE
 SECRET
 RELATIONSHIP
 BETWEEN
 FELISTER
 AND
 HIS
 PROT275 
 AT LEAST
 IN TERMS
 OF ALLOCATING
 THE
 FINANCES
 TO THE
 APPROPRIATE
 STRANDS,
 AND
 RAUL
 WAS
 USED
 AS THE
 PUNISHING
 BLADE
 INSIDE
 THE
 FARM.
 HIS
 HISTORY
 WAS
 MORE
 THAN
 CURIOUS,
 HAVING
 BEEN
 CAUGHT
 ON THE
 GROUNDS
 OF A NEW
 CATTLE
 RANCH
 FOR
 THE
 PURPOSE
 OF BRIBING
 LOCAL
 POLITICIANS
 OF INDIAN
 DESCENT
 WHILE
 THE
 DEALS
 WERE
 BEING
 DONE
 COURTESY
 OF BIG
 BROTHER,
 AND
 BLUEBIRD
 HAD
 PROVIDED
 THE
 POLITICAL
 CONTACTS
 HE WOULD
 NOW
 USE
 AT WILL.
 HE HIMSELF
 WAS
 ... THE
 DOPE
 WAS
 SOMETIMES
 CARRIED
 IN FUNERAL
 URNS,
 WHICH
 WERE
 DECORATED
 AS SOUVENIRS
 WITH
 TYPICAL
 INDIAN
 MOTIFS
 AND
 PLACED
 INSIDE
 THE
 WOODEN
 COFFINS-
ALTHOUGH
 TRADITIONAL
 INDIAN
 BURIAL
 METHODS
 ESCHEWED
 EMBALMING
 AND
 EVEN SOME
 OTHER
 PRACTICES,
 AND
 ACCORDING
 TO OFFICIAL
 TRADITIONS
 EACH
 FAMILY
 WAS
 TO TAKE
 CARE
 OF ITS
 OWN
 DEAD.
 BEING
 A MINORITY
 GROUP
 WITH
 OBVIOUS
 PRIVILEGES,
 WITH
 THE
 POWERS
 PROVIDED
 TO THEM BY THE
 STATE
 GOVERNMENT,
 NO ONE
 INTERFERED
 AT THEIR
 FUNERALS,
 AND
 THERE
 WAS
 EVEN THE
 PRACTICE
 OF RELATIVES
 OF SOME
 ON THE
 OTHER
 SIDE
 OF THE
 BORDER
 DEMANDING
 THAT
 THE
 DEAD
 BE SENT
 TO THEM
 TO BE BURIED
 ON NATIVE
 SOIL,
 AND
 THIS
 WAS
 A CONVENIENT
 OCCASION
 FOR CASKET
 REPLACEMENTS
 - WELL,
 IT WASN'T
 A VERY
 COMMON
 PRACTICE,
 BUT IT EXISTED
 NONETHELESS,
 AND
 WAS
 PERFECTLY
 IN ORDER.
 I KNOW
 IT SOUNDS
 DISGUSTING
 AND
 INHUMANE,
 BUT IT WAS
 A GOLD MINE.
 THE
 SIMPLE
 MATH
 SHOWED
 THAT
 HE WAS
 CONTACTED
 BY THE
 FEDS
 AFTER
 THAT,
 BUT NOT
 BEFORE
 HE WAS
 MYSTERIOUSLY
 PUT
 INTO
 MAPLEHURST,
 WHERE
 HE WAS
 QUITE
 ACCIDENTALLY
 SET
 UP FOR
 ASSASSINATION. 
- "THE
 WITNESS
 PROTECTION
 PROGRAM
 IS A COMPLETE
 LIE,"
 HE SAID
 DESPERATELY.
 "THEY
 PROTECTED
 ME AT FIRST,
 BUT
 SOON
 THE
 SITUATION
 CHANGED
 AND
 I WAS
 FORCED
 TO LEAVE
 IT MYSELF
 - ESPECIALLY
 WHEN
 MY TESTIMONY
 DIDN'T
 SIT
 WELL
 WITH
 THEM." 
276 
 THE
 SITUATION
 WITH
 FELISTER
 TURNED
 OUT
 TO BE MUCH
 MORE
 COMPLICATED
 THAN
 I HAD
 EXPECTED
 - THE
 MAN
 WAS
 REALLY
 RAUL'S
 BROTHER,
 AND
 HIS
 NAME
 WAS
 DIEGO... 
YES, YOU
 HEARD
 ME RIGHT... 
- "SO,
 THE
 ONE
 IN LA POINTE
 CEMETERY
 COULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 ANYONE
 ELSE,
 BUT
 NOT
 ..."
 - HE CONCLUDED
 QUIETLY. 

HE EXPLAINED
 THAT
 HE FELT
 A REAL
 FEAR
 FOR HIS
 LIFE
 AND
 DREAMED
 OF THE
 LATE
 RA277 
 - RAUL HAD
 LEFT
 SOME
 STRANGE
 MESSAGE
 BEFORE
 HE DIED,
 AND
 IT WAS
 THIS
 THAT
 I GAVE
 YOU.
 I BELIEVE
 YOU
 DECIPHERED
 IT AND
 UNDERSTOOD
 ITS
 MEANING,
 BECAUSE
 FRANKLY,
 I DIDN'T
 QUITE.
 YES,
 THE
 WORDS
 ARE
 SIMPLE
 AND
 OBVIOUS,
 BUT...
 RAUL
 HAD
 COMMITTED
 MANY
 SINS
 NOT
 FOR
 THE
 SAKE
 OF FELISTER,
 BUT
 SIMPLY
 TO SURVIVE.
 BUT
 HE WASN'T
 JUST
 A SINNER,
 HE WAS
 A TORTURED
 SOUL! 
BUT WHAT
 WAS
 THE
 SECRET
 OF SUFFERING?
 AND
 DID
 IT LEAD
 US ON THE
 ROAD
 TO SALVATION?
 I COULD
 SEE WHAT
 HELL
 DIEGO
 WAS
 GOING
 THROUGH.
 BUT
 WHAT
 WERE
 THE
 COLOURS
 OF HELL?
 I COULD
 UNDERSTAND
 THE
 CLEAR
 SPLITTING
 OF HIS
 PERSONALITY
 AND
 HIS
 DESIRE
 TO EMERGE,
 TO GO BACK,
 TO SEE THE
 WHOLE
 PICTURE,
 IF THAT
 WAS
 EVEN POSSIBLE.
 I WAS
 ACUTELY
 AWARE
 OF HOW
 HE FOUGHT
 FOR SALVATION
 - EVEN THOUGH
 THE
 NEXT
 TIME
 THE
 CARDS
 WERE
 DEALT
 - HE COULD
 BE WIPED
 OUT
 OF THE
 GAME
 FOREVER.
 BY THE
 WAY,
 THE
 SAME
 RULES
 APPLIED
 TO RULE
 BREAKERS
 - EVEN ANGELS
 COULD
 BE WIPED
 OUT
 OF IT TOO. 
MEXICANS
 WERE
 A TOUGH
 PEOPLE,
 USED
 TO ALL
 KINDS
 OF ADVERSITY
 AND
 TROUBLE.
 DIEGO
 HIMSELF
 HAD
 ALMOST
 LOST
 HIS
 LIFE
 IN PRISON
 - IT WAS
 GETTING
 SCARIER
 AND
 SCARIER.
 BUT AS MUCH
 AS I BANGED
 MY HEAD,
 THE
 STORY
 WAS
 FULL
 OF SOME
 OMISSIONS
 - LIKE
 WHETHER
 THE
 FEDS
 WERE
 FOLLOWING
 HIM
 HERE
 IN CANADA. 

I DEMANDED
 THAT
 HE REVEAL
 TO ME EXACTLY
 HOW
 HE HAD
 GOTTEN
 AWAY
 FROM
 THE
 FEDS,
 BECAUSE
 IT COULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 SIMPLE
 BAIT
 FOR US TO TAKE
 LIKE
 FISH. 

- "SHATTERED
 MY SOUL
 INTO
 A THOUSAND
 PIECES.
 I CAN'T
 EVEN FIGURE
 OUT
 WHAT
 MY REAL
 IDENTITY
 IS,"
 DIEGO
 ALMOST
 CRIED,
 "I'VE
 CHANGED
 IT MORE
 THAN
 A HUNDRED
 TIMES. 
278 
 I KNEW
 THAT
 IN THE
 PRACTICE
 OF THE
 FEDS
 - AND
 THE
 BEST
 AGENTS
 AT THAT
 - INTERROGATIONS
 COULD
 GO ON FOR
 WEEKS
 AND
 IT WAS
 ENTIRELY
 POSSIBLE
 THAT
 HE WOULD
 BE RECRUITED
 AND
 BROKEN. 
THE
 SITUATION
 IN MEXICO
 WAS
 MUCH
 MORE
 LIKE
 A CIVIL
 WAR,
 WHICH
 WAS
 NOW
 INTENSIFYING
 AND
 NOW
 WEAKENING
 ACCORDING
 TO THE
 INTERESTS
 OF THE
 VARIOUS
 CAMPS. 
IT WAS
 POSSIBLE
 THAT
 SOME
 TIP
 HAD
 BEEN
 GIVEN
 TO US ABOUT
 OUR
 STRANGE
 INVESTIGATION
 AND
 ... AFTER
 ALL,
 THE
 FACT
 THAT
 THE
 PRISON
 AUTHORITIES
 HAD
 AGREED
 TO COOPERATE
 WITH
 US DID
 NOT
 MEAN
 THAT
 THEY
 WERE
 GRAZING
 GRASS. 
NATURALLY,
 I MADE
 SURE
 THE
 CONVERSATION
 WAS
 BETWEEN
 THE
 TWO
 OF US - NO BYSTANDERS,
 ARLO
 AND
 ZONARA
 STOOD
 OFF TO THE
 SIDE
 A BIT,
 BUT
 I GUESSED
 THEY
 PICKED
 UP ON HIS
 EMOTIONAL
 VIBES. 
RAUL
 TOLD
 US THE
 SCARIEST
 PART,
 THAT
 FELISTER
'S IDEA
 BEHIND
 THE
 DUPLICATE
 NAMES
 WAS
 TO SOAK
 SOME
 IN CASE
 OF NEED
 - THE
 SCHEME
 WAS
 SIMPLE
 - THOSE
 WORKING
 USUALLY
 HAD
 FAKE
 PAPERS,
 AND
 ONLY
 IF THEY
 REALLY
 HAD
 TO HAVE
 THEM
 - FELISTER
 HAD
 GOOD AND
 TRUSTWORTHY
 FRIENDS
 IN THAT
 REGARD,
 AND
 SOME
 HAD
 ABSOLUTELY
 NONE
 AND
 COULDN'T
 EVEN MOVE
 WITHOUT
 THE
 OMNIPRESENT
 BREEDER'S
 PERMISSION.
 FELISTER
 DIDN'T
 EXPECT
 HIS
 EMPLOYEES
 TO BE INTELLECTUAL
 COLOSSI,
 AND
 IGNORANCE
 AND
 LACK
 OF REAL
 AMBITION
 WERE
 HIGHLY
 VALUED
 - ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND,
 FELISTER
 COULD
 DEFEND
 THE
 FARM
 AT LEAST
 BRIEFLY
 IN A PINCH
 - HE WAS
 UNDER
 NO ILLUSION
 THAT
 IF HE HAD
 A RAID
 LIKE
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN'S,
 HE'D
 GET
 AWAY
 WITH
 IT. 
RAUL
 HAD
 A TRACKING
 CHIP
 UNDER
 HIS
 SKIN
 - HOW
 DID
 I KNOW? 
279 
 THANKS
 TO THE
 ADVANCED
 MINIATURIZATION
 OF ELECTRONICS,
 THERE
 WERE
 SPECIAL
 MICROCHIPS
 THAT
 COULD
 BE INJECTED
 SUBCUTANEOUSLY
 WITH
 THE
 MOST
 ORDINARY
 NEEDLE,
 AND
 THE
 PRINCIPLE
 OF THEIR
 OPERATION
 WAS
 KNOWN
 AS "NEUR
AL DUST"
 - BY MONITORING
 NEURAL
 SIGNALS,
 CERTAIN
 SIGNALS
 WERE
 SENT
 TO A RECEIVER
 THAT
 REPORTED
 WHETHER
 THE
 RECIPIENT
 WAS
 TELLING
 THE
 TRUTH
 OR LYING. 
I DECIDED
 NOT
 TO GIVE
 MYSELF
 AWAY
 BY SEARCHING
 THE
 RAFT
 FOR
 HIDDEN
 DEVICES,
 AS ANYTHING
 COULD
 HAPPEN
 - THERE
 WAS
 A CHANCE
 WE COULD
 ALSO
 BE THE
 VICTIM
 OF AN UNAUTHORIZED
 FEDERAL
 WIRETAP,
 BUT I WASN'T
 ABOUT
 TO LET
 HIM
 GET
 AWAY
 WITH
 IT EITHER. 

I REALIZED
 THAT
 SOMETHING
 STRANGE
 WAS
 GOING
 ON WITH
 RAUL
 - HE WASN'T
 HIMSELF
 AND
 FELT
 PRESSURED. 

- "I
 CAN'T
 GO BACK
 TO MEXICO
 BECAUSE
 THEY
 SEE ME AS A FELISTER
'S MAN,
 I'M
 NOT
 ABLE
 TO STAY
 HERE
 EITHER
 - BECAUSE
 OF THE
 FEDERAL
 AGENTS
 WHO
 WILL
 SOONER
 OR LATER
 CLEAR
 ME, AND
 IN CANADA
 - I'M
 LOOKING
 AT A HARSH
 SENTENCE
 OF AT LEAST
 FIFTY
 YEARS
 UNDER
 A STRICT
 REGIME,"
 HE PRONOUNCED
 WITH
 UNDISGUISED
 SADNESS. 
I THOUGHT
 THAT
 DIEGO
 WAS
 GENERALLY
 QUITE
 RESPECTABLE
 IN THE
 FACT
 THAT
 HE HAD
 KEPT
 HIS
 FORMAL
 LOYALTY
 TO FELISTER,
 HAD
 NOT
 OF COURSE
 REFUSED
 COOPERATION
 TO THE
 FEDS.
 BUT IN EVERY
 SOCIETY
 THERE
 EXISTED
 WHAT
 WAS
 CALLED
 THE
 ARCHETYPAL
 FEAR
 OF DEATH-
IT WAS
 TOO DEEP
 AND INERADICABLE. 

 
 
 280 
 CHAPTER
 TWENTY-FOUR:
 THE
 DEMON 
 
DECIDED
 THAT
 WE MIGHT
 AS WELL
 DO SOMETHING
 FOR
 HIM-LET
 HIM
 GO,
 SINCE
 THERE
 WAS
 OBVIOUSLY
 NOTHING
 ELSE
 HE COULD
 DO FOR
 US.
 ANOTHER
 LOST
 SOUL.
 BUT
 SOMETHING
 INSIDE
 WOULDN'T
 LEAVE
 ME ALONE
 - I COULD
 DETECT
 SOMETHING
 STRANGE
 IN HIS
 EYES - I SOON
 REALISED
 IT,
 DIEGO
 WASN'T
 HUMAN,
 HE WAS
 A DEMON. 
- "YOU
 KNEW
 ME," HE SAID
 QUIETLY,
 "I
 FOLLOWED
 YOU
 ALL
 THE
 TIME
 AND
 CAUSED
 ALMOST
 ALL
 THIS
 SUFFERING,
 BUT
 I DIDN'T
 DO IT WITHOUT
 YOUR
 HELP.
 I JUST
 JUMPED
 FROM
 YOU
 ONTO
 THE
 POOR
 SOUL
 OF THIS
 DIEGO." 

- "WELL,
 IF IT REALLY
 IS YOU,"
 I SAID
 QUIETLY,
 "REALISING
 THAT
 MY ONE
 CONCENTRATED
 CONSCIOUSNESS
 - READY
 TO REACT
 DEFENSIVELY
 AND
 THE
 LITTLE
 GOLD
 RING
 WITH
 SOLOMON'S
 SEAL
 - WAS
 THE
 ONLY
 THING
 PROTECTING
 ME AT THE
 MOMENT,
 'WHY
 DIDN'T
 YOU
 REVEAL
 YOURSELF
 SOONER?
 YOU
 COULD
 HAVE
 SAVED
 US TOO
 MUCH
 TROUBLE
 AND
 TROUBLE,
 AND
 ALSO..."
 I DIDN'T
 FINISH. 
- "YES,"
 THE
 DEMON
 SPOKE
 IN AN INHUMAN
 VOICE,
 "BUT
 THAT
 WAY
 YOU
 WOULD
 NEVER
 HAVE
 GONE
 ON THIS
 WHOLE
 JOURNEY,
 AND
 YOU
 WOULDN'T
 HAVE
 FELT
 THE
 NATURE
 OF THE
 PROBLEM." 
- "WHAT
 IS YOUR
 NAME
?," I SPOKE
 IN A COMMANDING
 VOICE,
 BUT
 STILL
 FILLED
 WITH
 ENOUGH
 RESPECT. 
DEMONS
 WERE
 POWERFUL
 SPIRITS
 WITH
 LIMITED
 ENERGY,
 BUT
 IT WAS
 ALWAYS
 BETTER
 TO APPROACH
 THEM
 WITH
 RESPECT. 
THE
 DEMON
 REFUSED
 TO GIVE
 A SPECIFIC
 ANSWER. 
281 
 I THEN
 DECIDED
 TO USE
 ANOTHER
 PLOY
 THAT
 MIGHT
 YIELD
 AN EXCELLENT
 RESULT
 - OR SO I HOPED.
 I WAS
 AWARE
 THAT
 THERE
 WERE
 THREE
 BASIC
 LEVELS
 OF DEMONIC
 POSSESSION,
 IN THE
 LAST
 ONE
 ONE
 COULD
 LOSE
 EVEN ONE'S
 MIND,
 AND
 THE
 DEMON
 USED
 THE
 POSSESSED
 BODY
 FOR
 ITS
 OWN
 PURPOSES.
 A QUOTE
 FROM
 SCRIPTURE
 CAME
 TO MIND
 THAT
 WHEN
 THE
 UNCLEAN
 SPIRIT
 COMES
 OUT
 OF A PERSON,
 IT GOES
 THROUGH
 WATERLESS
 PLACES
 TO SEEK
 REST,
 AND
 FINDS
 NONE
47. PRACTICALLY
 EVERY
 DEMON
 WAS
 AFRAID
 OF WATER,
 AND
 THERE
 WAS
 A BODY
 OF WATER
 NEARBY
 - SO I WOULD
 NOT
 HESITATE
 TO PRY
 THE
 INFORMATION
 OUT
 THAT
 WAY.
 IN GENERAL,
 THE
 DEMONS'
 KNOWLEDGE
 WAS
 LIMITED
 COMPARED
 TO THE
 ALMIGHTY,
 BUT
 GREATLY
 EXCEEDED
 THAT
 OF HUMANS. 

- "I
 AM,"
 THE
 DEMON
 BEGAN,
 "I
 AM ..." 
- "TELL
 ME YOUR
 NAME!,"
 I ORDERED
 REPEATEDLY. 
I SOON
 LEARNED
 MORE
 ABOUT
 THE
 NATURE
 OF THIS
 DEMON,
 AND
 HE REVEALED
 TO ME SOME
 INTERESTING
 FACTS
 ABOUT
 THE
 DESIGN
 TO FOLLOW
 US ALL
 THIS
 WAY.
 DEMONS
 WERE
 DIVIDED
 INTO
 NINE
 DISTINCT
 LEVELS,
 AND
 THIS
 PARTICULAR
 ONE
 WAS
 OF THE
 FOURTH
 RANK
 AND
 WAS,
 ASSOCIATED
 WITH
 DEALING
 OUT
 RETRIBUTION.
 FROM
 WHAT
 HE CONFESSED
 AFTER
 I PRESSED
 HIM
 WITH
 SOME
 TECHNIQUES,
 FELISTER
 HAD
 MORE
 THAN
 ONCE
 CALLED
 HIM
 OUT
 ON HIS
 INFERNAL
 PLANS.
 THIS
 KIND
 OF DEMONS
 WERE
 TOO
 SPECIAL
 AND
 CONSISTED
 OF ONLY
 AIR
 AND ETHER
48. 
AFTER
 WE GOT
 THE
 INFORMATION,
 WE DECIDED
 IT WAS
 POINTLESS
 TO PUSH
 ANY
 FURTHER
 AND
 SIMPLY
 TOOK                                                
 47  (Matthew 12:43) 
48  Ether is the name of the material that fills the un
iverse outside 
the Earth sphere. 
282 
 DIEGO
 TO A MENTAL
 CLINIC
 WHERE
 HE WAS
 DEFINITELY
 IN NO DANGER
 OF ESCAPING. 
THE
 CLEVER
 TACTIC
 OF EXTRACTING
 THE
 HIDDEN
 KNOWLEDGE
 FROM
 THE
 DEMON
 WAS
 SOMEWHAT
 GOOD,
 BUT
 THERE
 WERE
 QUITE
 A FEW
 GAPS
 IN THE
 INFORMATION.
 BESIDES
 THE
 FACT
 THAT
 HIS
 NAME
 REMAINED
 UNKNOWN
 - WHICH
 IN THIS
 CASE
 WAS
 NOT
 OF PARAMOUNT
 IMPORTANCE,
 IT REMAINED
 AN OPEN
 QUESTION
 WHAT
 HAD
 PROVOKED
 RAUL
 TO TURN
 A BLIND
 EYE ALL
 THIS
 TIME. 
WE TIED
 UP DIEGO,
 AND
 ZONARA
 AND
 ARLO
 KEPT
 HIM
 IN THE
 BACK
 SEAT
 - WE HAD
 TO FIND
 AN EXORCIST
49 TO EXORCISE
 THE
 DEMON
 - OTHERWISE
 DIEGO
 COULD
 HAVE
 DIED,
 AND
 THAT
 WAS
 PROBABLY
 THE
 OTHER
 REASON
 HE HAD
 SOUGHT
 US OUT.
 WE WERE
 CURRENTLY
 IN ONTARIO
 TERRITORY
 BETWEEN
 MILTON
 AND
 MISSISSAUGA
 - NOT
 FAR
 FROM
 BLOOMFIELD
 CEMETERY
 - WE HAD
 TO DRIVE
 ABOUT
 A MILE
 TO GET
 THERE.
 WE WERE
 AWARE
 THAT
 THE
 CEMETERY
 WAS
 AN EXCELLENT
 PLACE
 TO OBSERVE
 DEMONIC
 AND
 UNCLEAN
 FORCES,
 AND
 DECIDED
 THAT
 THE
 EXORCISM
 COULD
 BE PERFORMED
 THERE.
 IT WAS
 UNTHINKABLE
 TO ASK
 FATHER
 TOBIAS
 TO SEND
 AN EXORCIST,
 AS HE HAD
 DONE
 ENOUGH
 FOR US,
 AND
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND
 THE
 SPECIALIST
 IN QUESTION
 COULD
 NOT
 HAVE
 ARRIVED
 SO QUICKLY.
 THEN
 I REMEMBERED
 THAT
 STRANGE
 TRAMP-I
 NOTICED
 THAT
 HE HAD
 BEEN
 FOLLOWING
 US FROM
 A DISTANCE
 THE
 SECOND
 TIME
 WE CROSS
ED THE
 MILTON. 
I DECIDED
 TO LEAVE
 ZONER
 AND
 ARLO
 WITH
 THE
 TIGHTLY
 BOUND
 DIEGO
 AT BLOOMFIELD
 CEMETERY
 PARK,
 WHICH
 BY THE
 WAY
 WAS
 NOT
 VERY
 BIG
 AND HAD
 AN AREA
 OF ABOUT
 TWO
 ACRES. 
                                               
 49 An exorcist is a specialist who chases away demons and 
evil 
spirits. 
283 
 I WENT
 BACK
 TO MILTON
 TO FIND
 THIS
 GUY,
 AS I REMEMBERED
 THAT
 I HAD
 SENSED
 HIS
 AURA
 - MAYBE
 HE WAS
 A HEALER
 OR A SHAMAN,
 BUT HE WAS
 FINANCIALLY
 BROKE
 AND
 FORCED
 TO LIVE
 IN A SHELTER
 OR RIGHT
 ON THE
 STREETS. 
BY SOME
 INEXPLICABLE
 MIRACLE
 HE HAD
 TRACKED
 US ALL
 THE
 WAY
 TO... 
 
CHAPTER
 TWENTY-FIVE:
 THE
 HEALER 
 
I HONESTLY
 DIDN'T
 EXPECT
 TO FIND
 HIM
 IN A TOWN
 OF OVER
 A HUNDRED
 THOUSAND
 PEOPLE,
 BUT
 BY SOME
 STROKE
 OF FATE,
 I DID. 
I SENSED
 HIS
 AURA
 AGAIN
 AND
 MENTALLY
 PROMPTED
 HIM
 TO APPROACH.
 I WASN'T
 SURE
 IF HE SENSED
 ME. ACTUALLY,
 I WASN'T
 SURE
 OF ANYTHING.
 AND
 GOT
 OUT
 OF THE
 CAR
 MYSELF,
 WHICH
 WAS
 PERHAPS
 A BIT
 RECKLESS.
 IN THE
 END
 I WAS
 COMPLETELY
 ALONE
 - I DIDN'T
 HAVE
 A WEAPON
 EITHER.
 I WAVED
 TO HIM,
 BUT
 I'M
 SURE
 HE PRETENDED
 NOT
 TO SEE ME. HE SEEMED TO DRIVE
 OFF
 TOWARDS
 A DARK
 ALLEY
 WHERE
 HE SEEMED
 TO DISAPPEAR. 
I FOLLOWED
 THE
 TRAIL,
 BUT
 FOU
ND ABSOLUTELY
 NOTHING.
 IT WAS
 TOO
 STRANGE. 
I FOLLOWED
 THE
 TRAIL,
 BUT
 FOUND
 ABSOLUTELY
 NOTHING.
 IT WAS
 TOO
 STRANGE. 
THEN
 I REALIZED
 HE WAS
 A HEALER.
 A HEALER
 HAD
 TO KNOW
 THE
 DIFFERENT
 METHODS
 OF HEALING
 AND
 WAS
 DIFFERENT
 FROM
 A SHAMAN.
 MENTAL
 ILLNESS
 COULD
 BE INTERPRETED
 AS THE
 BIRTH
 OF A HEALER
 AND
 WHETHER
 HE WAS
 SOMEHOW
 CONNECTED
 TO THE
 DEMON'S
 APPEARANCE
 IN DIEGO. 
284 
 I KNOW
 MY WORDS
 SEEMED STRANGE,
 BUT
 I DECIDED
 TO ASK
 HIM: 
- CAN
 YOU
 HEAL
 DIEGO? 
I DIDN'T
 EXPECT
 AN ANSWER,
 BUT I COULD
 HEAR
 A STRANGE
 VOICE
 IN MY HEAD
 SAYING
 THAT
 THE
 DEMON
 WOULD
 JUST
 DIE,
 BUT
 IT WOULDN'T
 DISAPPEAR
 COMPLETELY,
 AND
 DIEGO
 WOULD
 BE DEAD
 - IN OTHER
 WORDS,
 USELESS
 TO LEARN
 ANYTHING
 FROM.
 THIS
 BOTHERED
 ME A LOT.
 I ALSO
 REMEMBERED
 SINGING
 SHADOW'S
 REACTION
 AND
 HER
 INABILITY
 TO CONTROL
 THE DEMON
 IN THE
 RIGHT
 WAY,
 AND
 SUBSEQUENTLY
 HER
 REFUSAL
 TO HELP
 US. 
I DIDN'T
 KNOW
 WHAT
 WAY
 TO PERSUADE
 HIM
 OR WHAT
 TO OFFER
 - HE OBVIOUSLY
 DIDN'T
 WANT
 MONEY
 OR ANYTHING
 ELSE
 IN RETURN. 
AS I PONDERED,
 TIME
 WAS
 RUNNING
 OUT
 AND
 DIEGO
 COULD
 VERY
 WELL
 HAVE
 DIED.
 YES,
 THE
 DEMON
 WAS
 DRAWING
 ON HIS
 LIFE
 FORCE,
 AND
 THERE
 WAS
 NO WAY
 THAT
 WASN'T
 GOING
 TO BE FATAL. 
I HEARD
 A VOICE
 IN MY HEAD
 AGAIN
 - "WHEN
 A PERSON
 DIES,
 IT'S
 ACTUALLY
 GOOD
 NEWS
 FROM
 THE
 OTHER
 WORLD!
50" 
IN OUR
 CASE,
 HOWEVER,
 THE
 DEATH
 WOULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 CAUSED
 BY A DEMON.
 THE
 HEALER
 EXPLAINED
 SOMETHING
 ELSE
 TO ME, NAMELY
 THAT
 A PERSON
 WHO
 MERGED
 WITH
 THE
 ENERGY
 FROM
 THE
 OTHER
 WORLD
 WOULD
 SIMPLY
 BE CROSSED
 OUT.
 SHAMANS
 USED
 SPELLS
 AND
 HEALERS
 HEALED
 - IT WAS
 THAT
 SIMPLE. 
                                               
 50 The belief is of the Dagara tribe, which is an ethnic
 group in 
West Africa -Ghana and Burkina Faso. 
285 
 EVENTUALLY
 HE AGREED
 TO COME
 WITH
 ME, BUT HE SET
 A SERIOUS
 CONDITION
 THAT
 I WAS
 OBLIGATED
 TO MEET
 IF I WANTED
 TO SAVE
 DIEGO. 
- "YOU
 MUSTN'T
 SAY
 ANYTHING
 TO THE
 DEMON
 ABOUT
 ME," THE
 MAN
 REPLIED.
 "NEGATIVE
 ENTITIES
 ARE
 VERY
 CUNNING,
 AND
 SO IT WILL
 BE MUCH
 HARDER
 TO DESTROY
 OR EXPEL
 IT,
 AND
 WE CAN HARM
 THE
 DIEGO
 AS WELL." 
THE
 TWO
 OF US CLIMBED
 INTO
 THE
 VEHICLE
 WE'D
 BOUGHT
 WITH
 ARLO
 AND
 ZONARA,
 WHICH
 WAS
 A RICKETY
 FORD
 RANGER
 THAT,
 IN ADDITION
 TO ITS
 LARGE
 TRAILER,
 BOASTED
 A FAIR
 AMOUNT
 OF OFF-
ROAD
 CAPABILITY.
 THE
 SNOW
 CONTINUED
 TO PILE
 UP,
 AND
 THE
 SITUATION
 COULD
 HAVE
 BECOME
 CRITICAL
 TOMORROW
 MORNING,
 BUT
 AT THE
 MOMENT
 IT WAS
 AS IF SOME
 UNSEEN
 FORCE
 WAS
 MAKING
 IT RAIN
 A LITTLE
 MORE
 MODERATELY. 
THE
 STRANGER,
 FOR SOME
 REASON,
 SHOWED
 NO DESIRE
 TO RIDE
 BESIDE
 ME,
 BUT
 THREW
 HIMSELF
 INTO
 THE
 BACK
 OF THE TRAILER,
 BUT
 NOT
 BEFORE
 TELLING
 ME FOR THE
 FIRST
 TIME: 
- JUST
 AS THE
 ALMIGHTY
 HAS
 MANY
 NAMES,
 BUT BEHIND
 EACH
 OF THEM
 THE
 SAME
 ESSENCE,
 SO WE HEALERS
 KEEP
 THE
 COVENANTS
 OF OUR
 ART,
 AND
 THE
 PRINCIPLES
 OF OUR
 WORK,
 REGARDLESS
 OF CULTURE
 OR GEOGRAPHICAL
 LOCATION,
 DO NOT
 DIFFER
 MUCH.
 WE MUST
 NOT
 FORGET
 THAT
 HEALING
 IS MAINLY
 DONE
 ON AN ENERGETIC
 LEVEL,
 AS THE
 DAMAGE
 IS ALSO
 DONE
 ON AN ENERGETIC
 LEVEL.
 THINGS
 HAVE
 NOT
 CHANGED
 MUCH
 OR HARDLY
 AT ALL
 EVEN THOUGH
 WE ARE
 IN 2045. 
I NOTICED
 THAT
 YOU
 SPOKE
 OF TIME
 WITH
 SOME
 PARTICULAR
 DISREGARD
 - AS IF IT DIDN'T
 EXIST
 OR WASN'T
 THAT
 IMPORTANT.
 OR MAYBE
 IT WAS
 JUST
 A 286 
 PRODUCT
 OF OUR
 CONSCIOUSNESS
 MAKING
 CONTACT
 WITH
 ... 
WE CONTINUED
 ON OUR
 WAY,
 DRIVING
 VERY
 SLOWLY
 AND
 CAREFULLY
 SO AS NOT
 TO ENCOUNTER
 AN UNEXPECTED
 OBSTACLE. 
- THERE
 IS THAT
 EGO-DEATH,
 THAT
 PARTICULAR
 FORM
 OF MADNESS
 THAT
 IS NECESSARY
 FOR US TO GO BEYOND
 THE
 NORMAL
 WORLD
 IN ORDER
 TO EXPERIENCE
 REALITY
 MORE
 BEAUTIFULLY,
 MORE
 EXQUISITELY
 AND
 MORE
 DEEPLY
 - SO ITS
 CONTOURS
 TAKE
 ON DIFFERENT
 DIMENSIONS
 AND
 EVERYTHING
 SEEMS SOMEHOW
 MORE
 TIMELESS.
 OF COURSE
 THIS
 IS AS TRUE
 AS IT IS NOT,
 FOR
 IN GUIDING
 THEIR
 OWN
 LIVES
 AND
 THE
 LIVES
 OF OTHERS,
 THEY
 WILL
 INEVITABLY
 HAVE
 TO GO THROUGH
 CERTAIN
 TRIALS
 OF VARIOUS
 KINDS
 - THAT
 IS,
 THEY
 WILL
 PAY
 THE
 PRICE
 FOR
 THEIR
 KNOWLEDGE.
 WE HEALERS,
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND,
 ACT
 DIFFERENTLY
 BUT
 NO LESS
 EFFECTIVELY. 
I DIDN'T
 WANT
 TO ASK
 HIM
 WHERE
 THE
 DIFFERENCE
 WAS
 MAINLY
 BECAUSE
 DRIVING
 IN SUCH
 EXTREME
 CONDITIONS
 WAS
 QUITE
 DIFFICULT
 - YES WE ONLY
 HAD ABOUT
 TWO
 MILES,
 BUT
 FRANKLY
 THEY
 SEEMED
 LIKE
 TWO
 HUNDRED. 
WHEN
 A SNOWSTORM
 WAS
 OF VERY
 HIGH
 INTENSITY,
 LIKE
 THE
 ONE
 THAT
 HIT
 US THEN,
 AND
 MADE
 EVEN DRIVING
 ON THE
 STREETS
 OF MILTON
 DIFFICULT
 ENOUGH,
 AND
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND
 THE
 AMBIENT
 TEMPERATURES
 WERE
 BELOW
 FREEZING,
 ONE
 COULD
 EASILY
 BECOME
 DISORIENTED
 - YOU
 MAY
 NOT
 BELIEVE
 ME, BUT
 UNDER
 CERTAIN
 CONDITIONS
 ONE
 LOST
 THE
 ABILITY
 TO PERCEIVE
 ONESELF
 AS A SOCIAL
 PERSON.
 THERE
 WERE
 ALSO
 SIDE
 SYMPTOMS,
 SUCH
 AS LOSS
 OF SENSE
 OF SPACE
 AND
 TIME,
 BUT
 THE
 KEY
 POINT
 WAS
 THAT
 THERE
 WAS
 A TEMPORARY
 AND
 ACTUAL
 DISORIENTATION
 - AND
 THAT
 TOO
 WAS
 PART
 OF THE
 LAWS
 OF THE
 UNIVERSE
 AND
 OF TRUE
 MAGIC.
 SNOW
 287 
 ALSO
 HAD
 A CERTAIN
 SYMBOLISM
 THAT
 WAS
 SUFFICIENTLY
 AMBIGUOUS
 AND
 SUBJECT
 TO CERTAIN
 INTERPRETATIONS,
 BUT
 IN THIS
 CASE
 IT SIGNIFIED
 AN IMPORTANT
 CONVERSATION
 WITH
 A LOVED ONE. 
I CAST
 A FLEETING
 GLANCE
 AT THE
 STRANGER
 - I DON'T
 KNOW
 IF I WAS
 LIVING
 IN AN ILLUSION,
 ALTHOUGH
 I KNEW
 EXACTLY
 WHERE
 WE WERE
 GOING,
 BUT
 THE
 STRANGER
 SEEMED TO HAVE
 HIS
 FEET
 VERY
 FIRMLY
 PLANTED
 ON THE
 GROUND. 
THE
 SNOW
 CONTINUED
 TO POUR
 DOWN
 IN SHREDS
 THAT
 HAD
 FILLED
 ALMOST
 A QUARTER
 OF OUR
 PICKUP
 TRAILER,
 BUT
 HE STOOD
 THERE
 LIKE
 AN IDOL
 - BUT
 NOT
 OUT
 OF PRIDE
 - AS IF HE DIDN'T
 CARE
 AND
 WASN'T
 OF THIS
 WORLD
 AT ALL. 
WE'D
 LEFT
 THE
 OUTLINE
 OF MILTON
 AND
 DAMN
 OUR
 ROUTE
 LOOKED
 LIKE
 A CIRCLE
 - SO WE HAD
 SOME
 MAGICAL
 PROTECTION
 AFTER
 ALL
 - I WASN'T
 AWARE
 TO WHAT
 HEIGHTS
 THE
 STRANGER'S
 POWERS
 WERE,
 BUT I ASSUMED
 HE WAS
 ON THE
 LEVEL
 - IF HE COULD
 MAINTAIN
 THE
 ILLUSION
 OF INVISIBILITY.
 INCIDENTALLY,
 MOST
 PEOPLE
 DIDN'T
 EVEN REALISE
 THAT
 COMPLETE
 INVISIBILITY,
 WAS POINTLESS
 AND
 UNNECESSARY,
 AND
 COULD
 CAUSE
 A LOT MORE
 TROUBLE
 THAN
 GOOD,
 BUT I DIGRESS. 
- THAT
 ECSTASY
 THAT
 ALLOWS
 SHAMANS
 TO ACHIEVE
 SUCH
 STATES,
 AND
 WHICH
 HAS
 TO BE MANAGED
 ON A MUCH
 DEEPER
 LEVEL,
 AND
 AT THE
 SAME
 TIME
 IS THE
 KEY
 TO THE
 BLIZZARD
 MUFFLED
 HIS
 LAST
 WORDS.
 I COULD
 SEE HIM
 STANDING
 UNMOVED,
 FIRMLY
 GRIPPING
 WHAT
 PART
 OF THE
 BODY
 THAT
 COULD
 BE HIS
 SUPPORT
 AND
 KEEP
 HIM
 FROM
 FLYING
 OFF
 INTO
 TRAFFIC,
 GETTING
 STUCK
 UPSIDE
 DOWN
 IN ONE
 OF THE
 HUGE
 ROADSIDE
 DRIFTS. 
I HARDLY
 DROVE
 AT MORE
 THAN
 THIRTY
 MILES
 AN HOUR,
 BUT
 IN THESE
 CONDITIONS
 IT COULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 288 
 TANTAMOUNT
 TO DEATH,
 OR AT LEAST
 PERMANENT
 BRAIN
 DAMAGE. 
YES, IF ONE
 WAS
 HAPPY
 WITH
 WHAT
 ONE
 SAW
 IN ONE'S
 DREAMS,
 ONE'S
 WISHES
 WOULD
 MOST
 LIKELY
 COME
 TRUE,
 BUT
 THERE
 WERE
 SOME
 LIMITATIONS,
 OR MORE
 ACCURATELY
 ADJUSTMENTS,
 BUT
 ONE
 ALSO
 HAD TO TAKE
 INTO
 ACCOUNT
 HOW
 WELL
 THOSE
 ADJUSTMENTS
 FIT
 WITH
 REALITY. 
AFTER
 ALL,
 ALL
 SUPERNATURAL
 INTERVENTION
 MEANT
 WAS
 AN ADJUSTMENT
 TO REALITY
 - THERE
 WERE
 MANY
 LITTLE
 TRICKS
 TO BE USED
 TO BUILD
 UP SOME
 MAGICAL
 PROTECTION
 UNDER
 THE
 CIRCUMSTANCES.
 LET'S
 NOT
 FORGET
 THAT
 THE
 GOD
 OF DREAMS
 IN ANCIENT
 TIMES
 WAS
 A MESSENGER
 OF TRUTH
 - ONLY
 NOW
 EVERYTHING
 WAS
 REAL
 AND
 WE WEREN'T
 DREAMING
 AT ALL.
 YES,
 ONE
 OF THE
 SIMPLE
 MAGICAL
 TECHNIQUES
 TO PROTECT
 OURSELVES
 FROM
 EVIL
 EYES AND
 POSSIBLE
 INTERFERENCE
 OF SOMEONE
 ELSE
 IN OUR
 ENERGY
 FIELD
 WAS
 TO SIMPLY
 CLOSE
 OUR
 EYES AND
 IMAGINE,
 VISUALIZING
 CLEARLY
 ENOUGH
 A MASSIVE
 BRICK
 WALL
 THAT
 WAS
 LIT
 BY THE
 SUN.
 I KNOW,
 IT SOUNDED
 CRAZY
 - ESPECIALLY
 CONSIDERING
 THE
 CLIMATE
 OUTSIDE. 
HONESTLY
 - I THINK
 ONLY
 LACY
 HELL
 COULD
 BE MORE
 FREEZING
 THAN
 WHAT
 WAS
 RAMPANT
 AROUND
 US - THAT'S
 HOW
 DIRE
 THE
 SITUATION
 WAS. 
FINALLY,
 WE APPROACHED
 THE
 CEMETERY.
 I HAD TO MANEUVER
 VERY
 SKILLFULLY
 TO AVOID
 GETTING
 THE
 TIRES
 OF THE
 VEHICLE
 STUCK
 IN THE
 BRUTALLY
 DANGEROUS
 SNOW
 BANKS,
 AND
 IT WAS
 POSSIBLE
 THAT
 I MIGHT
 HOOK
 A STUCK
 ROCK
 OR BOULDER
 THAT
 WOULD
 ONLY
 CAUSE
 SOME
 ACCIDENT
 - WASN'T
 THIS
 A LIFE
 AND
 DEATH
 DILEMMA
 OF WHO
 WOULD
 BE SAVED? 
THE
 CEMETERY
 WAS
 ENTERED
 VIA
 A SIDE
 TURNOFF
 FROM
 THE
 MAIN
 ROAD,
 AND
 INTERNALLY
 I HOPED
 THAT
 ARLO
 AND
 THE
 ZONKER
 HADN'T
 FROZEN
 TO DEATH.
 IN 289 
 ADDITION
 TO THE
 AFOREMENTIONED
 PICKUP
 TRUCK,
 WE'D
 BOUGHT
 SPECIAL
 CLOTHES
 - SOMETHING
 BETWEEN
 A JACKET
 AND
 A RAINCOAT. 
AND
 WHAT
 WOULD
 HAPPEN
 IF THE
 TRIP
 NEVER
 ENDED?
 OR WAS
 IT OVER
 BEFORE
 IT EVEN STARTED?
 AND
 WHAT
 WAS
 THE
 POINT
 OF IT AT ALL? 
WE FOUND
 ZONARA
 AND ARLO
 HIDDEN
 UNDER
 A TREE
 AND
 SURROUNDED
 BY SNOW
 DRIFTS.
 THE
 SNOW
 PROVIDED
 THEM
 WITH
 EXCELLENT
 COVER,
 BUT
 THEY
 HAD
 BUILT
 A SMALL
 FIRE
 IN SECRET
 AND
 HAD
 PREPARED
 A GREEN
 TEA
 SCENTED
 WITH
 MOWN
 HAY
 AND
 WERE
 DRINKING
 IT NEAT.
 THEY
 HAD
 EVEN PREPARED
 A SMALL
 SHELTER,
 STRETCHING
 THE
 PICKUP'S
 AWNING
 TO PROTECT
 THEM
 FROM
 THE
 SNOW.
 IT WAS
 A BIT
 OF AN ODD
 QUIRK
 THAT
 STILL
 PROVIDED
 THEM
 WITH
 PARTIAL
 SHELTER. 
THE
 TWO
 OF THEM
 WERE
 OBVIOUSLY
 DISCUSSING
 SOMETHING,
 AND
 NOT
 FAR
 AWAY
 WE SAW
 DIEGO
 PICKING
 UP A SOUL
 - I EVEN WONDERED
 IF HE WAS
 STILL
 ALIVE. 

- "HIS
 CASE
 SEEMS
 GRAVE
 INDEED!,"
 THE
 STRANGER
 SPOKE
 QUIETLY.
 "THE
 DEMONIC
 INTERFERENCE
 SEEMS TO HAVE
 ENTERED
 ITS
 FINAL
 STAGES,
 WHICH
 WILL
 MAKE
 OUR
 TASK
 MORE
 DIFFICULT.
 BUT WE MAY
 AS WELL
 TRY." 
- "CLOSE
 YOUR
 EYES!,"
 ORDERED
 THE
 HEALER,
 "FOR
 THAT
 WAY
 THE
 DEMON
 WILL
 NOT
 BE ABLE
 TO ENTER.
 THEY
 USUALLY
 ENTER
 THROUGH
 THE
 EYES! INCIDENTALLY,
 THE
 INTENSIFICATION
 OF THIS
 STATE
 IS ASSOCIATED
 WITH
 THE
 INITIATION
 OF AN INNER
 DIALOGUE
 REGARDING
 VARIOUS
 MATTERS
 CONCERNING
 US.
 THIS
 RENEGOTIATION
 IN THE
 MIND
 PRACTICALLY
 PLACES
 SOME
 OTHERWORLDLY
 INTERLOCUTOR,
 WHICH
 GRADUALLY
 BECOMES
 PART
 OF THE
 MIND
 ITSELF
 AND
 THUS
 OPENS
 THE
 WAY
 FOR 290 
 ATTACK
 AND
 ONE
 BECOMES
 HELLISHLY
 DEFENSELESS.
 OF COURSE,
 NOT
 EVERYTHING
 IS THE
 FAULT
 OF THE
 OBJECT
 OF THE
 ATTACK
 IN THE
 CONVENTIONAL
 CASE,
 SOMETIMES
 THE
 GENERIC
 CURSE
 ALSO
 HAS
 AN INFLUENCE.
 BUT
 I DON'T
 WANT
 TO WASTE
 YOUR
 TIME
 WITH
 PLATITUDES,
 BECAUSE
 THE
 CASE
 IS SERIOUS.
 AS IN THAT
 OLD
 SAYING
 THAT
 IN ALL
 MADNESS
 THERE
 IS CONSISTENCY.
 HERE
 ARE
 SOME
 OF THE
 POSSIBLE
 CAUSES
 OR CONSEQUENCES.
 BUT
 DID
 GOOD
 MADNESS
 EXIST?" 

WAS
 NOT
 THIS
 DOOMED
 LONER
 A SAINT?
 THE
 SILENCE
 AROUND
 WAS
 LIKE
 MUSIC-THE
 SOUND
 OF THE
 DEAD.
 BUT IN SPITE
 OF THE
 STRANGE
 THOUGHTS
 THAT
 CROSSED
 MY MIND,
 I KNEW
 IT WAS
 NOT
 SO.
 AND YET WHAT
 ARE
 YOU
 WHEN
 YOU
 BELONG
 TO NO ONE?
 AND
 THAT
 WAS
 THE
 SAD
 THING.
 AS IF EVERYTHING
 BELONGED
 TO A BYGONE
 TIME! 
WE HASTENED
 TO DO HIS
 BIDDING.
 DIEGO
 WAS
 NOT
 HIMSELF
 AT ALL,
 AND
 A PECULIAR
 DEMONIC
 OBSESSION
 HAD
 EVIDENTLY
 SEIZED
 HIM,
 WHICH
 WOULD
 SOON
 DESTROY
 HIM.
 WE HAD
 TO BE CAREFUL,
 BECAUSE
 HE WAS
 REALLY
 OUR
 LAST
 CHANCE
 TO UNRAVEL
 THE
 STORY
 COMPLETELY,
 AND
 IN HIS
 PRESENT
 STATE
 HE COULD
 HARDLY
 EVEN REMEMBER
 HIS
 OWN
 NAME. 
I HOPED
 SOMEONE
 FROM
 AFAR
 WOULDN'T
 NOTICE
 THE
 STRANGE
 RITUAL
 AND
 INTERRUPT
 US BEFORE
 WE SAVED
 HIM.
 THERE
 WAS
 NOTHING
 AROUND
 THE
 CEMETERY
 PARK
 FOR AT LEAST
 TWO
 HUNDRED
 YARDS.
 EVERYTHING
 AROUND
 LOOKED
 PRETTY
 BLEAK
 AND
 CRAMPED.
 THE
 CADAVERINE
 AND
 PUTRESCINE
 SMELLED
 OF DECAYED
 FLESH,
 AND
 THE
 SCATOL
 ADDED
 THE
 SCENT
 OF FECES.
 THE
 TOMBSTONES
 HAD
 THOSE
 BEAUTIFUL
 HEXAFOIL
51, WHICH
 SYMBOLIZED
 MAGICAL
 PROTECTION
 FOR THE
 DEAD.
 THIS
 SIGN
 DATED
 BACK
 A                                                
 51 The hexafoil is a traditional motif from Gothic archite
cture that 
depicts a six-petalled lily. 
291 
 LONG
 TIME
 AND
 WAS
 QUITE
 TYPICAL
 EVEN IN BRITISH
 COLUMBIA
 IN CANADA.
 IT WAS
 DIFFICULT
 TO BUILD
 PERSONAL
 MAGICAL
 PROTECTION
 FOR
 THE
 UNINITIATED
 AND
 FOR THIS
 REASON
 THESE
 HEXAPHOILES
 WERE
 A STANDARD
 TOOL
 IN THIS
 REGARD.
 I GOT
 INTO
 THIS
 REASONING
 MOSTLY
 DUE TO THE
 FACT
 THAT
 IT WAS
 DIFFICULT
 TO BUILD
 LASTING
 ADDITIONAL
 DEFENSES
 ON THE
 GROUNDS
 OF THE
 CEMETERY
 AND
 WITH
 A DEMON
 ON ITS
 GROUNDS
 - SO WE DECIDED
 TO RELY
 ON THE
 ONES
 ALREADY
 IN PLACE
 - NO MATTER
 HOW
 STRONG
 OR WEAK
 THEY
 WERE.
 AS A RULE,
 CEMETERIES
 WERE
 A PLACE
 WITH
 A HEIGHTENED
 LEVEL
 OF NEGATIVE
 ENERGY,
 FROM
 WHICH
 PERHAPS
 THIS
 DEMON
 WAS
 ALSO
 ABLE
 TO DRAW
 STRENGTH,
 BUT WHAT
 I KNEW
 FOR SURE
 WAS
... THE
 RITUAL
 SEEMED DANGEROUS
 INDEED,
 AND
 THERE
 WAS
 ABSOLUTELY
 NO GUARANTEE
 THAT
 IT WOULD
 BE SUCCESSFUL,
 MUCH
 LESS
 THAT
 DIEGO
 WOULD
 SURVIVE.
 I ALSO
 KNEW
 THAT
 THE
 VICTIM
 HAD
 TO BE APPROACHED
 CAREFULLY
 IN THIS
 REGARD
 AND
 THEIR
 SINS
 HAD
 TO BE TAKEN
 INTO
 ACCOUNT,
 WHICH
 COULD
 ALSO
 BE THE
 CAUSE
 OF FURTHER
 ATTACK
 FROM
 THE
 DEMON
52. 
DIEGO
 WAS
 DEFINITELY
 ACTING
 PECULIAR,
 BUT SOME
 OF HIS
 SYMPTOMS
 WERE
 ALL
 TOO
 OBVIOUS
 AND
 CONSISTED
 OF FEELING
 COLD
 - YES, IT WAS
 INDEED
 FREEZING
 COLD
 IN MARCH
 ALL
 AROUND,
 BUT NOTHING
 IN THE
 SURROUNDINGS
 COULD
 BE THE
 CAUSE,
 AS DIEGO
 WAS
 PLACED
 NEAR
 THE
 FIRE,
 BUT
 WAS
 CLOSELY
 GUARDED
 BY ARLO
 AND ZONAR
 LEST
 HE JUMP
 INTO
 IT,
 SPURRED
 ON BY THE
 DEMONIC
 PRESENCE. 
                                               
 52 This rule is laid out in Corey Ten Boom's book "Defeated
 Enemies" in Chapter Six, Demon Load and Demon Possession. 
292 
 - "OPEN
 YOUR
 EYES, DIEGO,"
 THE
 HEALER
 CLAPPED
 HIS
 HANDS
 AND BEGAN
 THE
 PROCEDURE
 OF FREEING
 HIM
 FROM
 THE
 DEMON. 
HIS
 WHOLE
 BODY
 WAS
 SHAKING
 LIKE
 THAT
 OF A FEVER
 PATIENT
 AND
 HE HAD
 GLAZED
 HIS
 EYES - IN THEIR
 MIRRORED
 SURFACE
 I SAW
 THE
 DARKNESS
 OF MADNESS,
 BUT
 NOT
 THE
 ONE
 EVERYONE
 WAS
 TALKING
 ABOUT,
 BUT
 THE
 OTHER
 ONE
 THAT
 SHOWED
 THE
 LACK
 OF A PATH. 
APPARENTLY
 THE
 DEMON
 HAD
 A FIRM
 GRIP
 ON HIM
 AND
 WOULDN'T
 LET
 GO.
 HIS
 HANDS
 AND
 FEET
 MOVED
 QUICKLY,
 SURE
 SIGNS
 THAT
 HE HIMSELF
 WAS
 TRYING
 TO RID
 HIMSELF
 OF THE
 ACCURSED
 FOE.
 BUT
  THEN
 THE
 STRANGER
 RESORTED
 TO A VERY
 STRANGE
 RITUAL
 TO DEAL
 WITH
 THE
 INSIDIOUS
 AND
 UNKNOWN
 POSSESSOR. 

- "WE HAD
 MANAGED
 TO LEARN
 SOMETHING
 FROM
 HIM,"
 I MURMURED,
 "I
 HOPE
 THIS
 WILL
 HELP
 SO THAT
 WE CAN
 FORCE
 HIM
 TO LEAVE
 THE
 VICTIM." 
THE
 STRANGER
 REALIZED
 EXACTLY
 WHAT
 TYPE
 OF DEMON
 HE WAS
 DEALING
 WITH. 
- "LOOK,
 I'M
 NOT
 GOING
 TO LIE TO YOU
 - IT'S
 GOING
 TO BE HARD,"
 THE STRANGER
 GROANED.
 "I'M
 A HEALER,
 AND
 I KNOW
 FOR A FACT
 THAT
 THE
 PLAGUE
 OF CONSCIOUSNESS
 IS LIKE
 THE
 PLAGUE
 OF SWINE
 - ONE
 COULD
 EASILY
 CATCH
 IT.
 SOMETIMES
 IT CAN
 EVEN BE A WHOLE
 LEGION
 OF DEMONS
 POSING
 AS A SINGLE
 ONE,
 WHICH
 CAN
 FURTHER
 CONFUSE
 US." 
AFTER
 THE
 INSTRUCTIONS
 THUS
 SPOKEN,
 HE GOT DOWN
 TO THE
 HEALING
 PART
 IN EARNEST
 - THERE
 WASN'T
 MUCH
 TIME,
 AND
 IF ANYTHING
 WENT
 WRONG
 THE
 WHOLE
 POINT
 OF EVERYTHING
 EXPERIENCED
 SO FAR
 WAS
 LOST.
 THE
 STAKES
 WERE
 HUGE! 
293 
 IT WASN'T
 LONG
 BEFORE
 DIEGO
 STARTED
 SPITTING
 BLOOD
 - THINGS
 WERE
 TAKING
 AN ALARMING
 TURN
 AND
 ANY
 HOPE
 OF SALVATION
 WAS
 DWINDLING. 
THE
 HEALER
 DIDN'T
 GIVE
 UP AND
 DECIDED
 TO USE
 ANOTHER
 TACTIC
 - NOW
 THAT
 IT WAS
 AWARE
 OF THE
 DEMON'S
 MAKE-BELIEVE,
 IT DECIDED
 TO WEAKEN
 ITS GRIP
 BY REDUCING
 ITS
 CONCENTRATION
 BY DIVERTING
 IT AWAY
 FROM
 THE
 DIEGO'S
 WEAKNESSES,
 FROM
 WHICH
 IT DREW
 ENERGY
 FOR
 ITS
 SURVIVAL. 
- THIS
 DEMON
 WAS
 NOT
 REAL,
 BUT
 A CONCEIVED
 FORM
 CREATED
 THROUGH
 MAGICAL
 RITUAL.
 I CAN
 SEE THE
 SIGNS
 OF THIS
 VERY
 CLEARLY
 - IT SEEMS
 KIND
 OF LAZY
 AND
 STIFF
 TO ME, AND
 NOT
 THAT
 DIVERSE. 
I KNEW
 AN AWFUL
 LOT
 ABOUT
 DEMONIC
 CREATURES,
 BUT THIS
 STRUCK
 ME AS ODD,
 IF THE
 DEMON
 WAS
 INDEED
 ARTIFICIAL,
 THEN
 ALL
 MY ATTENTION
 TO THE
 DEVELOPMENT
 WAS
 POINTED
 IN THE
 WRONG
 DIRECTION.
 SUCH
 ARTIFICIAL
 CREATURES
 COULD
 BE CREATED
 IN A MORE
 VARIED
 WAY
 THAN
 VOODOO
 SORCERERS,
 EXORCISTS
 AND
 SO ON.
 OR PERHAPS
 THE
 SPIRIT
 ITSELF
 WAS
 CLEVERLY
 USING
 SOME
 MENTAL
 DISORDER
 OF THE
 DIEGO
 ITSELF
 - SUCH
 AS A SPLIT
 PERSONALITY,
 FOR EXAMPLE
 - TO DRINK
 FROM
 ITS
 ENERGY
 AND
 MANIPULATE
 IT. 
WE DECIDED
 TO JOIN
 FORCES
 TO FIGHT
 THE
 DEMON
 AND
 LOOK
 AT WHICH
 CHAKRA
 HIS
 NEGATIVE
 INFLUENCE
 WAS
 DIRECTED
 AT - I KNOW
 SUCH
 AN APPROACH
 DIDN'T
 SHINE
 WITH
 ORIGINALITY,
 BUT
 AT THE
 MOMENT
 IT WAS
 IMPORTANT
 TO SAVE
 HIS
 LIFE. 
THE
 HEALER
 AGREED
 TO TRY
 THIS
 AND
 FOUND
 THAT
 THE
 DEMON
'S INFLUENCE
 WAS
 ON THE
 FIRST
 CHAKRA
 ASSOCIATED
 WITH
 SURVIVAL
 - FEAR,
 WHICH
 IN TURN
 WAS
 LATCHING
 ONTO
 AND
 CHANNELING
 THE
 ENERGY
 TO OTHER
 HIGHER
 LEVEL
 CHAKRAS
 - THAT
 IS,
 THE
 DIEGO
 WOULD
 SUFFER
 BOTH
 FROM
 THE
 294 
 CORRESPONDING
 EMOTIONS
 CHARACTERISTIC
 OF THOSE
 CHAKRAS,
 BUT ALSO
 FROM
 SOMETHING
 MUCH
 WORSE
 - HE COULD
 BE PHYSICALLY
 AFFECTED
 IN A VARIETY
 OF BODY
 PARTS. 
- "I
 AM WRITING
 A GREAT
 RIDDLE,"
 THE
 HEALER
 BEGAN
 IN A TREMBLING
 VOICE,
 "WHOEVER
 CREATED
 THIS
 EXTRAORDINARY
 CONCEIVED
 FORM
 WAS
 A GENIUS,
 BECAUSE
 IT COEXISTS
 WITH
 THE
 TRUE
 DEMON
 AND
 EVEN HELPS
 IT TO MANIPULATE
 THE
 MIND
 OF THE
 VICTIM.
 BUT
 THE
 IDEA
 HERE
 IS MUCH
 DEEPER
 - IT WAS
 TO UNDERMINE
 THE
 IDENTITY
 OF THE
 CHAKRA,
 AND
 MOST
 OF ALL,
 THE
 DIEGO
 ITSELF.
 I KNOW
 IT SOUNDS
 CONFUSED
 TO YOU,
 BUT
 THE
 DEMON'S
 DESIRE
 TO
 SURVIVE
 IS LINKED
 TO THE
 ANCIENT,
 FUNDAMENTAL
 INSTINCT
 TO SURVIVE,
 I.E.
 THE
 DEMON'S
 FEAR
 ALSO
 BECOMES
 THE
 FEAR
 OF THE
 DIEGO
 ITSELF,
 AND
 EVEN,
 AS TRITE
 AS IT SOUNDS,
 THE
 DIEGO
 ITSELF
 WOULD
 PROBABLY
 FIGHT
 MUCH
 HARDER
 THAN
 ITS
 MALEVOLENT
 POSSESSOR
 FOR
 ITS
 SURVIVAL,
 BECAUSE
 IF IT PERISHED,
 THE
 DIEGO
 ITSELF
 WOULD
 PERISH.
 AND
 THAT
 CREATES
 A RATHER
 SPECIFIC
 SITUATION,
 SINCE
 WHEN
 HE FEELS
 THREATENED
 HE WILL
 DOMINATE
 ALL
 OTHER
 FUNCTIONS
 OF THE
 VICTIM'S
 MIND." 
IT SOUNDED
 LOGICAL,
 BUT
 ALSO
 DAMN
 SAD
 - WE WERE
 IN A CIRCLE
 OF SOME
 HELLISH
 DOOM,
 AND
 IT WAS
 GETTING
 SMALLER
 AND
 SMALLER. 
ME, ARLO
 AND
 ZONARA
 GASPED
 WHEN
 WE HEARD
 THIS.
 NOT
 THAT
 IT WASN'T
 THEORETICALLY
 POSSIBLE,
 BUT
 SUCH
 A SUPREME
 SYMBIOSIS
 BETWEEN
 A REAL
 DEMON
 AND
 A CONCEIVED
 FORM
 WAS
 IMPRESSIVE.
 IT LEFT
 OPEN
 THE
 QUESTION
 OF WHO
 COULD
 DO SOMETHING
 SO ORIGINAL? 

BUT THEN
 SOMETHING
 SO BRUTAL
 OCCURRED
 TO ME THAT
 I DIDN'T
 EVEN WANT
 IT TO CROSS
 MY MIND.
 AND
 IF IT WAS
 TRUE
 THE
 PICTURE
 WAS
 ALMOST
 STARTING
 TO 295 
 BECOME
 CLEAR
 TO ME FOR
 THE
 FIRST
 TIME
 - LET'S
 BE PRECISE
 THIS
 ABOVE
 AND
 BELOW
 CAST
 A PALL
 OVER
 AT LEAST
 HALF
 OF IT.
 IF THE
 TWO
 DIEGANS,
 WHO
 WERE
 TWINS
 BY FATE,
 WERE
 ADOPTED,
 WITH
 ONE
 OF THEM
 SUBSEQUENTLY
 DISOWNED
 BY THE
 GREEDY
 BREEDER,
 WASN'T
 IT POSSIBLE
 TO CREATE
 A BOND
 RIGHT
 BETWEEN
 THEM
 AND
 THE
 DEMONIC
 VISITORS
 THEMSELVES,
 AND
 IF THAT
 DEMON
 WAS
 FEEDING
 OFF
 THE
 DIEGO
 ITSELF
 AND
 HAD
 TAKEN
 ALMOST
 COMPLETE
 CONTROL
 OF ITS
 BODY,
 WHERE
 WAS
 THE
 BODY
 OF THE
 OTHER
 DIEGO
 - OR PARVENU
 JAKE? 
BECAUSE
 IN THAT
 CASE
 IT RAISED
 A HUGE
 QUESTION
 MARK
 THAT
 COULD
 HAVE
 PROVED
 FATAL
 FOR
 ALL
 OF US. 

I REMEMBERED
 FELISTER
'S PROFOUND
 THOUGHT-
WHOEVER
 FOUND
 MY INHERITANCE
 WOULD
 ... 
- "I
 SCENT,"
 CONTINUED
 THE
 HEALER,
 "THAT
 HIS
 SUFFERING
 HAS
 BEEN
 VERY
 CAREFULLY
 PLANNED,
 AND
 THERE
 IS A STRONG
 PROBABILITY
 THAT
 HE WILL
 DIE.
 BUT THERE
 ARE
 STILL
 SOME
 THINGS
 TO DO TO GET
 RID
 OF HIM." 
IN THE
 STATE
 THAT
 DIEGO
 WAS
 IN,
 IT WAS
 DOWNRIGHT
 COUNTERPRODUCTIVE
 TO MOVE
 HIM,
 AND
 WE HAD
 TO DECIDE
 HOW
 TO FIGHT
 OFF
 THIS
 STUBBORN
 DEMONIC
 TYRANT,
 WHO
 WAS
 CLEARLY
 GOING
 TO PROVE
 PIVOTAL
 IN SOLVING
 THE
 MYSTERY
 OF FELISTER
'S LEGACY. 
THE
 SNOW
 CONTINUED
 TO FALL
 IN SHREDS,
 AND
 I HAD
 TURNED
 OFF
 THE
 PICKUP'S
 HEADLIGHTS
 AND
 PARKED
 IT IN A WAY
 THAT
 MADE
 IT BARELY
 VISIBLE
 TO THE
 FLICKERING
 FIRE
 IN THE
 CEMETERY
 PARK. 
ZONER
 AND
 ARLO
 WERE
 ALL
 FULLY
 CONCENTRATED
 ON ASSISTING
 THE
 HEALER.
 I ALSO
 HOPED
 I COULD
 BE OF SOME
 USE
 TO HIM
 AND
 MY ENERGY
 WOULD
 ADD
 UP AS WELL. 
296 
 IF IT HAD
 BEEN
 WARM,
 OR IF IT HAD
 BEEN
 DAY,
 THERE
 WOULD
 STILL
 BE SOME
 FORM
 OF LIFE
 HERE,
 BUT
 THE
 FREEZING
 NIGHT
 ONLY
 SHOWED
 THE
 UTTER
 HOPELESSNESS
 OF OUR
 ENDEAVOR. 
AND
 YET THE
 HEALER
 WOULD
 NOT
 GIVE
 UP AND
 WOULD
 TRY
 ABSOLUTELY
 ANYTHING. 
AFTER
 A FEW
 MORE
 FRUITLESS
 ATTEMPTS,
 WE DECIDED
 TO JOIN
 FORCES
 TO BEAT
 THE
 DEMON. 
I FIGURED,
 THOUGH,
 THAT
 SOME
 PROPER
 LATIN
 INCANTATION
 WOULD
 DO A PRETTY
 GOOD
 JOB
 AND WE COULD
 GET
 HIM
 TO LOOSEN
 HIS
 GRIP
 AND
 THUS
 BETTER
 DEFEAT
 HIM.
 IT WAS
 KNOWN
 THAT
 LATIN
 WAS
 CONSIDERED
 JUST
 ABOUT
 THE
 MOST
 PERFECT
 LANGUAGE
 BECAUSE
 OF A NUMBER
 OF FEATURES
 IT POSSESSED,
 AND
 THERE
 WAS
 TOO MUCH
 MYSTICISM
 IN IT,
 AND
 BESIDES
 IT WAS
 A UNIVERSAL
 LANGUAGE,
 AND
 THAT
 FACT
 MADE
 IT IDEAL
 FOR THE
 PURPOSE
 WE WERE
 AFTER.
 THE
 INCANTATION
 WAS
 VERY
 LONG
 INDEED,
 AND
 QUITE
 COMPLICATED: 
- CRUX SACRA
 SIT
 MIHI
 LUX!
 NUNQUAM
 DRACO
 SIT
 MIHI
 DUX.
 VADE
 RETRO
 SATANA!
 NUNQUAMSUADE
 MIHI
 VANA!
 SUNT
 MALA
 QUAE
 LIBAS.
 IPSE
 VENENA
 BIBAS
53!  THESE
 HOLY
 WOR
DS SEEMED TO HAVE
 SOME
 EFFECT
 ON THE
 DEMON,
 AND
 I BEGAN
 TO REPEAT
 THEM
 IN A LILTING
 TONE-YES,
 THIS
 INCANTATION
 WAS
 ONLY
 TO BE UTTERED
 BY A PRIEST,
 BUT
 I STILL
 HOPED
 IT WOULD
 WORK. 

SUDDENLY
 I HEARD
 A VOICE
 IN MY EARS
 - "OKAY,
 I'LL
 LEAVE,
 BUT DIEGO
 HIMSELF
 WILL
 REVEAL
 THE
 TRUTH
                                                
 53 Let the holy cross be my light! May the dragon never be
 my 
guide. Go Satan! Never tempt me with your vanity. What 
you 
offer me is evil. Drink the poison yourself! 
297 
 TO YOU,
 AND
 YOU
 MIGHT
 NOT
 LIKE
 IT!
 SO BE MAD
 AT YOURSELF!" 

KNOWING
 THE
 LIES
 OF THE
 DEMONS,
 THERE
 WAS
 NO NEED
 FOR HIM
 TO TELL
 ME ALL
 THIS.
 BUT
 TO OUR
 AMAZEMENT,
 HE DID
 LEAVE
 DIEGO
 - WELL,
 NOT
 QUITE
 RIGHT
 AWAY.
 IT TOOK
 A FEW
 MINUTES,
 BUT
 HE LEFT
 ANYWAY. 

WHETHER
 OR NOT,
 STRANGE
 AS IT SOUNDED,
 DIEGO
 HADN'T
 CLUNG
 TO THE
 DEMON
 HIMSELF
 TO KEEP
 HIM
 AND
 HIMSELF
 FROM
 SEEING
 THE
 TRUTH
 - SURELY
 THE
 SYMBIOSIS
 BETWEEN
 THEM
 WAS
 MUTUALLY
 BENEFICIAL.
 BUT HAD
 THE
 ARTIFICIAL
 DEMON
 STILL
 REMAINED?
 I ASKED
 THE
 SHAMAN
 TO CHECK
 IT OUT,
 AND
 HE SAID
 HE STILL
 FELT
 SOME
 INFLUENCE
 OF THE
 CONCEIVED
 FORM
 ON DIEGO. 
HE SLOWLY
 OPENED
 HIS
 EYES,
 AND
 I SAW
 ALL
 HIS
 PAIN
 AND
 EXHAUSTION
 - FOR
 HIM,
 THE
 JOURNEY
 WAS
 OVER
 ANYWAY.
 THE
 DEMON
 WAS
 JUST
 HELPING
 HIM
 LIVE,
 OR RATHER
 EXIST,
 CONSIDERING
 THIS
 TO BE LIFE
 - FOR A VERY
 SHORT
 TIME. 
FELISTER
 WAS
 RIGHT
 - HIS
 LEGACY
 WAS
 FULL
 OF MUCH,
 MUCH,
 TOO MUCH
 SADNESS
 AND
 UTTER
 HOPELESSNESS.
 WHAT
 I WAS
 BEGINNING
 TO REALISE
 BETTER
 AND
 BETTER,
 WITH
 EACH
 STEP
 OF DISCOVERING
 THE
 TRUTH,
 WAS
 JUST
 HOW ALONE
 THE
 MAN
 REALLY
 WAS
 IN LIFE. 
DURING
 THE
 WHOLE
 RITUAL
 OF RELEASING
 DIEGO
 FROM
 THE
 DEMON
 - BOTH
 ARLO
 AND
 ZONARA
 WERE
 FORMALLY
 PRESENT,
 LIKE
 EMPLOYEES
 WHO
 WERE
 ON THE
 JOB.
 THE
 UNKNOWN
 HEALER,
 AFTER
 THE
 ENTIRE
 RITUAL
 WAS
 COMPLETED,
 STATED: 
- I CAN
 DO NO MORE
 THAN
 THIS.
 HE WOULD
 FOREVER
 BE SCARRED
 BY HIS
 ENCOUNTER
 WITH
 THE
 DEMON
 FOR THE
 SIMPLE
 REASON
 THAT
 A SMALL
 PART
 OF THE
 NEGATIVE
 ESSENCE
 WOULD
 REMAIN
 WITH
 HIM
 - AT 298 
 LEAST
 UNTIL
 THE
 MOMENT
 OF HIS
 DEATH.
 ONLY
 THEN
 WILL
 THE
 DEMON
 LEAVE
 HIM
 FOREVER. 
DIEGO
 ACCEPTED
 THE
 NEWS
 CALMLY
 - ALBEIT
 WITH
 A PALE
 FACE,
 WHICH
 WAS
 QUITE
 HAGGARD
 FROM
 ALL
 THE
 PURIFICATION
 RITUALS.
 I HAD
 TO REPEAT
 THE
 MAGIC
 FORMULA
 IN LATIN
 REPEATEDLY
 TO GET
 RID
 OF HIM.
 I REPEATED
 IT A WHOLE
 SEVENTY-TWO
 TIMES
 - NOT
 THAT
 I WAS
 LOOKING
 FOR SPECIAL
 SYMBOLISM,
 ANYWAY,
 BUT THE
 NUMBER
 OF DEMONS
 IN SOLOMON'S
 LITTLE
 KEY
 WAS
 SEVENTY-TWO
 - AND
 DECIDED
 THAT
 NUMBER
 WASN'T
 BAD
 AT ALL.
 WELL,
 MAYBE
 WE WASTED
 A LITTLE
 EXTRA
 TIME,
 BUT
 IT WAS
 STILL
 A BENEFIT,
 PLUS
 DIEGO
 WOULD
 HAVE
 APPRECIATED
 THE
 REST
 OF HIS
 LIFE
 A LOT
 BETTER. 
 
CHAPTER
 TWENTY-SIX:
 FEDERAL
 AGENTS 
 
WE DECIDED
 TO DRIVE
 HIM
 TO ASHGROVE,
 WHICH
 WAS
 PRACTICALLY
 AN UNINCORPORATED
 COMMUNITY,
 TOO,
 SINCE
 THE
 DISTANCE
 WAS
 ONLY
 FOUR
 OR FIVE
 MILES
 IN A NORTHWESTERLY
 DIRECTION.
 THE
 SNOWSTORM
 SEEMED TO HAVE
 ABATED,
 BUT
 THE
 SITUATION
 REMAINED
 AS DIRE
 AS EVER.
 THE
 SNOW
 DRIFTS
 WERE
 BLOWN
 BY THE
 WIND
 ALONG
 THE
 ROAD
 AND
 FORMED
 PECULIAR
 WALLS
 OVER
 A FOOT
 AND
 A HALF
 HIGH,
 BUT
 WE WERE
 STILL
 ABLE
 TO SEE
 SOME
 TREES
 IN THE
 DISTANCE.
 IT WAS
 AS IF I WAS
 IN SOME
 EMPTY
 SPACE
 THAT
 SEEMED
 ENDLESS
 AT FIRST
 GLANCE,
 BUT
 IN FACT
 BY DESIGN
 IT WASN'T
 EXACTLY,
 AND
 I WAS
 COMPLETELY
 ALONE
 IN SOME
 FLAT
 SCENARIO
 UNFOLDING...
 MAYBE
 I WASN'T
 ON MY OWN.
 OR? 
ARLO
 AND
 ZONARA
 STEPPED
 INTO
 THE
 ROLE
 OF NAVIGATOR
 AND
 PILOT
 - AS IF WE WERE AT SOME
 SORT
 OF OFF-ROAD
 RACE: 
299 
 - "NO,
 NOT
 HERE.
 A LITTLE
 FURTHER
 ON,"
 ZONARA
 CALLED
 SOMEWHAT
 ABRUPTLY,
 "WE NEED
 TO GET
 TO ASHGROVE
 ON ROAD
 THREE,
 WHICH
 IS AFTER
 THE
 TURN-OFF
 FOR..." 
I THANKED
 HER
 MENTALLY
 FOR THE
 INFORMATION
 AS ARLO
 HAD TAKEN
 TO DRIVING
 THAT
 WAY. 
IT TOOK US ABOUT
 HALF
 AN HOUR
 TO GET
 THERE,
 AS THE
 PICKUP,
 THOUGH
 INFREQUENT,
 WOULD
 SKID
 AND
 WE EVEN HAD
 TO GET
 OFF
 AND
 PUSH
 IT TWO
 OR THREE
 TIMES
 TO GET
 IT TO START
 AGAIN.
 IT WAS
 HARD
 ENOUGH.
 YEAH,
 I KNOW,
 IT SEEMED
 KIND
 OF CORNY,
 BUT IT WAS
 HELL. THE
 UNKNOWN
 HEALER'S
 NAME
 WAS
 YAKUBA,
 AND
 HE INTRODUCED
 US TO HIS
 HOMELAND'S
 IDEAS
 OF SPIRITUAL
 GROWTH,
 WHICH
 OVERALL
 I WOULD
 SAY
 WAS
 NOT
 AT ALL
 REDUNDANT. 
SUDDENLY
 THE
 PICKUP
 PULLED
 UP... 
I GLANCED
 BACK QUICKLY
 - LEST
 FOR SOME
 REASON
 DIEGO
 HAD
 BEEN
 RE-POSSESSED
 - ALTHOUGH
 AFTER
 THE
 BRUTAL
 SERIES
 OF EXORCISM
 RITUALS
 HE HAD
 BEEN
 CONDUCTING,
 HE SHOULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 CONSCIOUS.
 YES,
 HE WAS
 INDEED
 FINE...
 IT WAS
 JUST
 THAT
 THE
 PICKUP'S
 TIRE
 HAD
 GONE
 THROUGH
 A HUGE
 CLUMP
 OF SNOW
 THAT
 ARLO
 HAD
 NO WAY
 OF AVOIDING
 WHILE LISTENING
 TO ZONARA
'S INSTRUCTIONS.
 THAT
 CALMED
 ME DOWN
 A BIT. 
I WAS
 AWARE
 THAT
 THE
 HEALER
 HAD
 SOMETHING
 ELSE
 TO SHARE
 WITH
 US.
 WE WERE
 NOW
 SO CLOSE
 TO THE
 ASHGROVE
 THAT
 I COULD
 ALMOST
 SEE IT IN FRONT
 OF MY NOSE. 
- ACCORDING
 TO THE
 BELIEFS
 OF MY PEOPLE,
 HEALING
 CAN
 TAKE
 MANY
 FORMS.
 THERE
 IS A MIND,
 A SOUL
 AND
 A SPIRITUAL
 PLANE
 WHERE
 EVERYTHING
 HAPPENS.
 THIS
 IS THE
 VISIBLE
 AND
 INVISIBLE
 WORLD,
 AND
 WHEN
 300 
 YOU
 NEED
 TO HEAL
 SOMEONE
 YOU
 NEED
 TO TOUCH
 EACH
 OF THESE.
  HIS
 EXPLANATION
 SEEMED
 TO ME RELATIVELY
 SIMPLISTIC,
 BUT
 AT THE
 SAME
 TIME
 OF IMMENSE
 DEPTH
 OF THOUGHT. 
I REMEMBERED
 THAT
 FELISTER
 WAS
 ALSO
 READING
 A PARTICULAR
 BOOK
 WHERE
 IT WAS
 EXPLAINED
 THAT
 A PERSON
 HAD
 ONE
 MAIN
 CONSCIOUSNESS
 BUT
 SEVERAL
 AUXILIARY
 CONSCIOUSNESSES,
 AND
 THIS
 AGAIN
 WAS
 RELATED
 TO SPIRITUAL
 INTERACTIONS
 ON DIFFERENT
 LEVELS. 

BE THAT
 AS IT MAY,
 WE ENTERED
 THE
 ASHGROVE,
 WHICH
 WAS
 HUSHED,
 AND
 TOOK
 UP OUR
 QUARTERS
 IN A HOUSE,
 WHERE
 THE
 HOSPITABLE
 LANDLORD
 SIMPLY
 MOVED
 OUT
 WITH
 THE
 EXCUSE
 THAT
 HE WAS
 IN A GREAT
 HURRY,
 AND
 LET
 US HAVE
 IT FOR
 A VERY
 MODEST
 RENT.
 LEST
 ANYONE
 GET
 THE
 WRONG
 IMPRESSION,
 ASHGROVE
 WAS
 A VERY
 SMALL
 COMMUNITY
 CONSISTING
 OF JUST
 A HANDFUL
 OF BUILDINGS
 - SO FOR THE
 DURATION
 OF OUR
 SHORT
 STAY
 WITH
 DIEGO,
 WE WEREN'T
 GOING
 TO HURT
 ANYONE.
 WE MIGHT
 HAVE
 STAYED
 HERE
 ONLY
 A DAY
 OR TWO,
 AND
 MIGHT
 EVEN
 HAVE
 LEFT
 IT IN THE
 EVENING,
 HAD
 WE BEEN
 ABLE
 TO QUESTION
 THE
 DIEGO
 HIMSELF
 MORE
 QUICKLY,
 IN WHOM
 WAS
 NOW
 ALL
 OUR
 HOPE. 
WHEN
 WE CAME
 OUT
 INTO
 WHAT
 WAS
 ALMOST
 HIS
 ONLY
 STREET,
 I HEARD
 BIRDSONG
 FOR
 THE
 FIRST
 TIME,
 AND
 I HAD
 NOT
 HEARD
 THEM
 FOR SOME
 TIME-THEY
 WERE
 THE
 LINK
 BETWEEN
 HEAVEN
 AND EARTH.
 SOME
 SPARROWS
54 WERE
 MURMURING
 THROUGH
 THE
 AIR,
 AND
 I WONDERED
 IF THIS
 TIME
 WE WOULD
 BE RELIEVED
 OF THE
 GREAT
 BURDENS
 WE CARRIED
 IN OUR
 SOULS.
                                                 
 54  Sparrows are a symbol of hope, fertility and resurrection. 
301 
 DIEGO
 WAS
 ACTUALLY
 ABLE
 TO TELL
 US THE
 REST
 OF THE
 STORY,
 WHICH
 HAD
 TO DO WITH
 FELISTER
'S HERITAGE.
 THERE
 WAS
 A SMALL
 CAFE
 NEARBY
 WHERE
 WE COULD
 HAVE
 EATEN,
 BUT
 WE DECIDED
 TO GIVE
 DIEGO
 SOME
 TIME
 TO REST.
 AFTER
 ABOUT
 A QUARTER
 OF AN HOUR
 WE HEADED
 THERE
 - FRANKLY
 THIS
 KIND
 OF SETTLEMENTS
 WERE
 A COMPLETE
 DEAD
 LETTER
 AND
 SOMETIMES
 THERE
 WERE
 ONLY
 A FEW
 PEOPLE,
 OR EVEN JUST
 ONE
 OR TWO
 (USUALLY
 A FAMILY)
 WHO
 OWNED
 THE
 PLACE
 AND
 LIVED
 OR EXISTED
 IN THEIR
 OWN
 LITTLE
 WORLD
 - WELL,
 THAT
 WASN'T
 EXACTLY
 THE
 CASE
 HERE,
 BUT ... 
IN GENERAL,
 THE
 SURROUNDINGS
 OF ASHGROVE
 WERE
 NOT
 BAD
 AT ALL
 - IT WAS
 JUST
 THAT
 SOMEHOW
 I HAD
 THE
 FEELING
 THAT
 WE OURSELVES
 WERE
 EITHER
 HELL
 IN THE
 PLACE
 OR NOT
 QUITE. 
DIEGO
 ATE
 A SANDWICH
 AND DRANK
 A COKE
 WITH
 OBVIOUS
 RELISH
 - I GUESS
 HE DIDN'T
 LIKE
 THE
 FOOD THAT
 MUCH,
 BUT
 HE HAD
 CERTAIN
 CONDITIONED
 BIOLOGICAL
 NEEDS
 THAT
 SHOULD
 AT LEAST
 BE FORMALLY
 SATISFIED,
 LIKE
 SATIATING
 HIS
 HUNGER,
 SINCE
 EVEN THE
 CAFE-RESTAURANT'S
 PROPRIETOR
 WASN'T
 AROUND,
 BUT THERE
 WERE
 OBVIOUS
 SIGNS
 THAT
 SHE
 WAS
 INDEED
 AVAILABLE,
 AND
 DECIDED
 TO EXPLAIN
 THE
 NEXT
 PART
 OF THE
 STORY,
 AND
 FROM
 THERE
 ON OUR
 PATHS
 DIVERGED.
 WE DID
 NOT
 ASK
 HIM
 ABOUT
 HIS
 FURTHER
 INTENTIONS.
 DIEGO
 WAS
 VERY
 REALISTIC
 AND
 PERCEIVED
 TIME
 AS A DISCRETE
 QUANTITY.
 ACCORDING
 TO QUANTUM
 THEORY,
 THE
 FACT
 THAT
 TIME
 WAS
 CONTINUOUS
 WAS
 SIMPLY
 AN ILLUSION,
 SINCE
 TIME
 WAS
 SIMPLY
 A CRYSTALLINE
 STRUCTURE
 CONSISTING
 OF DISCRETE
 REPEATING
 ELEMENTS
55. BUT,
 AS AN OLD FRIEND
 ONCE
 TOLD
 ME, "ALL
 YOU
 HAVE
 IS THIS
 MOMENT.
 SO LIVE
 FOR IT AND
                                                
 55  Mir Faizal, "Time crystals of minimal time uncertainty," 
published in The European Physical Journal C. 
302 
 ONLY
 IT,
 AS NOTHING
 ELSE
 EXISTS!
 EVERYTHING
 ELSE
 JUST
 ISN'T
 REAL
 AND
 WHEN
 YOU
 FIGURE IT OUT
 MAYBE
 YOU'LL
 WISH
 YOU
 WERE
 NEVER
 BORN
 OR YOU'LL
 JUST
 ACCEPT
 THINGS
 AS THEY
 ARE
 - PART
 OF THE
 BIG
 GAME
 AND
 FOLLOW..." 
DIEGO
 EXPLAINED
 MANY
 OF THE
 MISSING
 DETAILS
 OF THE
 PUZZLE
 I HAD
 THOUGHT
 ALMOST
 UNSOLVABLE,
 AND
 IN FACT
 FELISTER
'S SCHEME,
 BESIDES
 BEING
 DOOMED,
 HAD
 TURNED
 OUT
 TO BE TRULY
 INGENIOUS.
 ZONARA
 AND ARLO
 TOOK
 ALMOST
 NO NOTICE.
 ONLY
 ARLO
 HAD
 TAKEN
 A BITE
 OUT
 OF A COOKIE
 WITH
 APPARENT
 RELISH.
 MAYBE
 ITS
 FILLING
 WAS
 MORE
 SPECIAL
 - WHO
 KNOWS!
 YES, THEY
 WERE
 IN THE
 HUMAN
 WORLD
 AND
 HAD
 TO LOOK
 HUMAN,
 OR AT LEAST
 PRETEND
 TO LOOK
 HUMAN
 - THEY
 WERE
 ON THE
 JOB
 AFTER
 ALL
 AND
 HAD
 TO FOLLOW
 THE
 RULES
 OF THE
 GAME
 JUST
 LIKE
 EVERYONE
 ELSE! 
SUDDENLY
 THE
 OWNER
 APPEARED
 - SHE
 LOOKED
 A RAGGED
 WOMAN,
 BUT ONE
 WHO
 WOULD
 DO ANYTHING
 IN HER
 POWER
 TO PLEASE
 HER
 GUESTS. 
- "I
 AM MILBETH
 SARDEN
56. MY HUSBAND
 AND I USED
 TO ROTATE
 THIS
 PLACE
 BUT HE PASSED
 AWAY
 RECENTLY
 - MAYBE
 THE
 CLIMATE
 AROUND
 HERE
 DIDN'T
 AGREE
 WITH
 HIM.
 AND
 I HONESTLY
 DON'T
 BLAME
 HIM.
 WITH
 AGE,
 ONE
 GAINS
 EXPERIENCE,
 WHICH
 IS INVALUABLE,
 AND
 GENERALLY
 LEARNS
 TO LIVE
 WITH
 MUCH,
 MUCH
 LESS,"
 THE
 OLD WOMAN
 MUTTERED
 MEANINGFULLY. 
THEN
 SHE
 WALKED
 AWAY
 AND HID
 SOMEWHERE
 FAR
 AWAY
 AND SANK
 INTO
 THE
 SHADOWS
 OF DARKNESS.
 IT WAS
 STARTING
 TO GET
 DARK,
 AS I MAY
 HAVE
 NEGLECTED
 TO MENTION
 THAT
 ALL
 THE
 PREVIOUS
 DAY                                                
 56 The heroine's name is a play on words - Milbeth means 
"Lover 
of Travel" or "Trustworthy," and Sarden means "Honeybee," 

which symbolizes society. 
303 
 WE'D
 BEEN
 TRYING
 TO SOMEHOW
 GET
 SETTLED
 IN ASHGROVE
 - AT LEAST
 FOR
 A WHILE. 
AND
 SO DIEGO'S
 NARRATIVE
 BEGAN: 
- AS YOU
 WELL
 KNOW,
 THE
 MASTER
 SPIRIT
 OR CONSCIOUSNESS
 NEED
 NOT
 BE EXACTLY
 THE
 SAME
 AS THE
 PHYSICAL
 BODY,
 BUT
 THE
 AUXILIARY
 CONSCIOUSNESS
 OR AUXILIARY
 CONSCIOUSNESSES
 CAN
 BE AND
 USUALLY
 ARE
 HIGHER
 LEVEL
 SPIRITS,
 AND
 SOMETIMES
 MUCH
 HIGHER.
 YOU
 KNOW,
 DECISIONS
 ARE
 USUALLY
 MADE
 BY THE
 MASTER
 SPIRIT,
 BUT
 THAT
 IS NOT
 ALWAYS
 THE
 CASE
 AT ALL.
 SO AS WE SAID,
 THE
 MASTER
 SPIRIT
 COULD
 ALSO
 BE DELUDED,
 LED
 ASTRAY
 BY ITS HUMAN
 BROTHER,
 WITH
 WHOM
 THEY
 WERE
 BORN
 TOGETHER
57 - BEGAN
 DIEGO
 FROM
 AFAR. 
WE LISTENED
 TO HIM
 ATTENTIVELY.
 DIEGO
 HAD
 A GIFT
 FOR WORDS
 AND
 TRIED
 TO CONVEY
 THINGS
 AS SIMPLY
 AND
 CLEARLY
 AS POSSIBLE.
 ONLY
 I NOTICED
 THAT
 ARLO
 AND
 ZONARA
 SEEMED TO FLINCH
 SLIGHTLY
 - PERHAPS
 THE
 CONVERSATION
 WAS
 NOT
 ENTIRELY
 PLEASANT
 TO THEM
 WITH
 ITS
 DIRECTNESS,
 OR PERHAPS
 THEY
 SIMPLY
 EXISTED
 ON ANOTHER
 VIBRATIONAL
 LEVEL.
 DIEGO'S
 WORDS
 WERE
 OBVIOUSLY
 AFFECTING
 THEM
 DIRECTLY
 - MORE
 OR LESS. 

I ALSO
 HAD
 THE
 SUPERNATURAL
 FEELING
 THAT
 SOONER
 OR LATER
 THE
 FEDS
 WOULD
 COME
 - AND
 THIS
 TIME
 THEY
 REALLY
 DID.
 MAYBE
 THEY
 WERE
 WATCHING
 US - IN SOME
 INVISIBLE
 AND
 UNEXPLAINABLE
 WAY,
 OR MAYBE
 WE WERE
 JUST
 LEFT
 WITH
 A CLOSED
 MIND
 - UNABLE
 TO SEE
 CERTAIN
 THINGS. 
- FELISTER
 NEEDED
 TWO
 PEOPLE
 WITH THE
 NAME
 DIEGO
 AND
 WITH
 ROUGHLY
 THE
 SAME
 FATE
 - WE WERE
 BOTH
 ORPHANED
 DERELICTS
 WITH
 UNKNOWN
 PARENTS,
                                                
 57 Li Hongzhi, Zhuan Falun, Sofia, 2013, Ciela Norma AD
 304 
 SINCE,
 AS YOU
 WELL
 KNOW
 - ONE
 OF US IS DEAD
 AND
 MAYBE
 THAT'S
 PRACTICALLY
 THE
 ONLY
 DIFFERENCE
 BETWEEN
 US.
 AND
 WHAT
 YOU
 DON'T
 KNOW
 IS THAT
 I SWITCHED
 BODI
ES, OR RATHER
 I MOVED
 THE
 DEAD
 DIEGO'S
 BODY
 BECAUSE
 I SUSPECTED
 THAT
 SOONER
 OR LATER
 SOMEONE
 WOULD
 STILL
 LOOK
 FOR
 HIM
 AND
 REGARDLESS
 OF THE
 PHYSICAL
 CONDITION
 OF THE
 BODY
 - HIS
 AURA
 WOULD
 BE THERE.
 AND
 I THINK
 I DID
 THE
 RIGHT
 THING
 - THIS
 IS THE
 KEY
 TO FELISTER
'S LEGACY
 ITSELF,
 BUT
 FAR
 FROM
 BEING
 THE
 END
 OF THE
 STORY,
 IT IS ONLY
 THE
 BEGINNING
 OF THE
 END.
 AND
 THAT
 ENDING
 MAY
 NOT
 COME,
 OR MAY
 NOT
 COME
 EXACTLY
 AS YOU
 WISH.
 HERE'S
 AN EXAMPLE
 WITH
 ME AND
 THE
 DEMON... 
AGAIN
 THERE
 WAS
 SILENCE. 
- THUS
 HE HAD
 TWO
 GOATS
 TO PLAY
 THE
 SAME
 GAME
 WITH.
 FELISTER
'S PROBLEM
 WAS
 THAT
 HE WANTED
 TO PLAY
 ON BOTH
 LOW AND
 HIGH
 VIBRATIONS,
 AND
 THAT
 MEANT
 CONTACT
 AND
 CONNECTION
 WITH
 COMPLETELY
 DIFFERENT
 ENERGIES
 - IT WAS
 NOT
 SO EASY
 TO MAKE
 THAT
 SWITCH,
 AND
 SO HE CHOSE
 THE
 SECOND
 OPTION,
 WHICH
 AS YOU
 CAN
 SEE HE CALLED
 FELISTER
'S LEGACY.
 YOU
 KNOW,
 EVERY
 LITTLE
 THING
 IN THIS
 UNIVERSE
 REPRESENTS
 A SPECIFIC
 VIBRATION
 THAT
 IS CONNECTED
 IN A PARTICULAR
 WAY
 TO THE
 WHOLE.
 BY ISOLATING
 HIMSELF
 IN THIS
 WAY,
 FELISTER
 LOST
 CONTACT
 WITH
 HIS
 GUARDI
AN ANGEL
 AND
 THINGS
 WENT
 COMPLETELY
 WRONG.
 THE
 KEY
 TO FELISTER
'S UNRAVELLING
 WAS
 THAT
 HE WANTED
 TO CORRECT
 REALITY
 IN A VERY
 SPECIFIC
 AND
 PROFITABLE
 WAY
 FOR HIMSELF,
 WHICH
 OF COURSE
 SOONER
 OR LATER
 COULD
 PROVE
 DANGEROUS.
 AND
 THAT
 INCREASED
 THE
 LIKELIHOOD
 THAT
 HE HIMSELF
 IN THE
 NEW
 VERSION
 OF REALITY
 WOULD
 ALSO
 BE ERASED.
 FELISTER
 HAD
 ASSUMED
 DIFFERENT
 NAMES
 AND
 USED
 DIFFERENT
 DEMONS
 TO COMMUNICATE
 WITH
 POLITICIANS
 AND
 MOBSTERS
 - IT WORKED,
 OR SO IT SEEMED.
 IT WAS
 NECESSARY,
 FOR BUSINESS,
 FOR THE
 PRESERVATION
 305 
 OF HIS
 OWN
 CONSCIOUSNESS,
 AND
 FOR ALL
 OF US WHO
 LIVED
 UNDER
 HIS
 WING
 - FOR THE
 PRESERVATION
 OF THIS
 ENTIRE
 MICROCOSM.
 HE HAD
 CHOSEN
 TO ASK
 THE
 QUESTION
 OF WHAT
 LIFE
 WAS
 IN A RATHER
 WRONG
 WAY... 

- "WHAT
 I DON'T
 FULLY
 UNDERSTAND
 IS ... WAS
 HE TRYING
 TO PLAY
 THE
 ROLE
 OF THE
 ALMIGHTY
?," I ASKED
 HIM. 
- "NOT
 EXACTLY.
 EVEN
 JUST
 THE
 OPPOSITE.
 NOT
 AT ALL,"
 DIEGO
 CHIMED
 IN,
 SOMEWHAT
 ODDLY,
 "HE
 WAS
 TRYING
 TO SLYLY
 PASS
 BETWEEN
 THE
 DROPS,
 AND
 THE
 CREATION
 MODEL
 DOESN'T
 WORK
 THAT
 WAY
 - AND
 NEVER
 HAS
 WORKED
 THAT
 WAY.
 AND IT'S
 UNLIKELY
 TO WORK." 

ZONARA
 PERHAPS
 INWARDLY
 WANTED
 TO SHOOT
 ME WITH
 HER
 EYES,
 BUT
 STOPPED
 HERSELF.
 SHE
 WAS
 CLEARLY
 TRYING
 TO MAINTAIN
 HER
 PROFESSIONALISM.
 ARLO
 WAS
 STILL
 MUNCHING
 ON THE
 COOKIE
 - APPARENTLY
 IT WAS
 THE
 MOST
 IMPORTANT
 THING
 ON EARTH
 TO HIM
 - IT SEEMED TO REMIND
 HIM
 OF HOME.
 A FORGOTTEN
 FEELING!
 I WAS
 BEGINNING
 TO GET
 A CLEAR
 SENSE
 OF WHERE
 THE
 CONVERSATION
 WAS
 GOING
 AND
 THAT
 IT WAS
 STARTING
 TO GET
 DANGEROUS
 - PERHAPS
 A LOT
 MORE
 SO THAN
 BEFORE. 
- FELISTER
 HAD
 SIMPLY
 TRIED
 TO OPEN
 THOUSAN
DS OF ENERGY
 CHANNELS
 AND
 CONTROL
 THEM,
 BUT CONTRADICTIONS
 AROSE
 BETWEEN
 THESE
 SAME
 LEVELS
 OF CONSCIOUSNESS,
 AND
 IN THIS
 LINE
 OF THOUGHT
 SOMETHING
 VERY
 UNPLEASANT
 AND
 INAPPROPRIATE
 RESULTED,
 WHICH
 OF COURSE
 COULD
 NOT
 BE FULLY
 FELT
 IMMEDIATELY
 BECAUSE
 OF THE EXTREME
 COMPLEXITY
 OF HIS
 DESIGN.
 AT THE
 LEVEL
 OF PRACTICE
 AND
 CONTROL
 HE POSSESSED,
 THERE
 WAS
 A LOGICAL
 TRICK
 THAT
 HAD
 APPARENTLY
 CREATED
 A CONTRADICTION
 FOR
 HIM,
 NAMELY,
 IF CHECKING
 THE
 OPERATION
 OF A SPELL
 MEANT
 THAT
 IT WAS
 TO BE 306 
 TERMINATED,
 THERE
 WAS
 A SPECIAL
 INSTRUCTION
 TO CONTINUE
 TO MAINTAIN
 IT EVEN IN THE
 EVENT
 OF A POSITIVE
 ANSWER
 TO TERMINATE
58. IN THAT
 LINE
 OF THOUGHT,
 FELISTER
 HAD
 BEEN
 UNABLE
 TO SHIFT
 HIS
 OWN
 LINE
 OF CONSCIOUSNESS
 AND
 HAD
 SUBSEQUENTLY
 ARRIVED
 AT ...
 YES,
 HE HAD
 MADE
 THE
 TRIVIAL
 MISTAKE,
 WHICH
 I DON'T
 BELIEVE
 WAS
 UNINTENTIONAL
 BY THE
 WAY,
 THAT
 CONSCIOUSNESS
 IS UNITY
 RATHER
 THAN
 TAKING
 A MUCH
 MORE
 PRACTICAL
 AND
 FLEXIBLE
 APPROACH
 - THAT
 IS,
 HE HAD
 SOUGHT
 ANSWERS
 WITHOUT
 BEING
 ENTIRELY
 SURE
 WHAT
 QUESTION
 THEY
 REFERRED
 TO.
 AND
 IN HUGE QUANTITIES.
 THIS
 IS RATHER
 REMINISCENT
 OF THE
 CASE
 OF THE
 FAMOUS
 DIOPHANTINE
 EQUATION
 ABOUT
 THE
 MEANING
 OF LIFE.
 WELL,
 IF FELISTER
 HAD
 HAD ENOUGH
 TIME
 IN THAT
 RESPECT
 MAYBE
 IT WOULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 A LITTLE
 DIFFERENT
 AND
 HE WOULD
 HAVE
 ARRIVED
 AT THE
 RIGHT
 ANSWER
 - DIEGO
 PAUSED
 FOR A MOMENT
 TO COLLECT
 HIS
 THOUGHTS,
 BUT
 I SENSED
 THAT
 THE
 MOST
 INTERESTING
 PART
 WAS
 YET TO COME. 
IN ALL
 HONESTY,
 WE'D
 BEEN
 IN ASHGROVE
 RELATIVELY
 RECENTLY,
 BUT
 ALREADY
 THE
 PLACE
 FELT
 COMPLETELY
 DEVOID
 OF MEANING
 - LIKE
 A BEAUTIFUL
 BACKDROP
 IN THE
 MIDDLE
 OF NOWHERE,
 AND
 I EVEN WONDERED
 HOW
 REAL
 ITS
 SOLE
 PROPRIETOR
 WAS,
 WHO
 HAD
 DISCREETLY
 HIDDEN
 HERSELF
 AWAY
 SOMEWHERE,
 BUT WOULD
 OBVIOUSLY
 TURN
 UP IF WE ACTUALLY
 NEEDED
 HER
 SERVICES. 
- HOWEVER,
 WHY
 FELISTER
 NEEDED
 TWO
 BODIES
 - THE
 REASON
 WAS VERY
 SIMPLE
 - SOONER
 OR LATER
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN
 HIMSELF
 HAD
 TO DO WHAT
 HE                                                
 58 The idea comes from British computer scientist Alan Turin
g, 
who shows that a certain computer program can stop on its 

own, but here it is combined with the esoteric idea of 
spiritual 
work on many levels. 
307 
 HAD
 TO DO,
 BUT
 ONLY
 IF SOMETHING
 WENT
 WRONG
 AND
 FELISTER
'S END
 CAME. 
- "YOU
 MEAN
 THAT
 FELISTER
 PROGRAMMED
 HIS
 OWN
 DEATH

 THE
 YAKUBA
 HEALER,
 WHO
 HAD
 BEEN
 STANDING
 ON THE
 SIDELINES
 OF THE
 WHOLE
 CONVERSATION
 BUT
 HADN'T
 LOST
 SIGHT
 OF IT AT ALL,
 REMARKED
 SOMEWHAT
 ODDLY,
 "OR
 EVEN MEANT
 THAT
 IF SOMETHING
 HAPPENED
 TO HIM,
 A SERIES
 OF RELATIVELY
 'PLANNED'
 CONSEQUENCES
 WOULD
 ENSUE
 AS A RESULT
 OF IT.
 SORT
 OF LIKE
 THE
 BUTTERFLY
 EFFECT." 
- SOMETHING
 LIKE
 THAT
 - ONLY
 MISTER
 EMBANKS
 WANTED
 TO DO IT IN A WELL
 PLANNED
 WAY,
 OR AT LEAST
 IN A WAY
 THAT
 HE COULD
 GET
 AWAY
 WITH.
 THIS
 DESIGN
 WAS
 OF COURSE
 QUITE
 SIMILAR
 TO THE
 CHAOS
 CODE
 ALREADY
 MENTIONED,
 AND
 WAS
 ABOUT
 MINIMAL
 DEVIATIONS
 THAT
 OVER
 TIME
 GAVE
 RISE
 TO CHAOTIC
 BUT NOT
 RANDOM
 NETWORKS
 OF CAUSE
 AND
 EFFECT
 THAT
 COULD
 ESCALATE
 AND
 BECOME
 GLOBAL.
 BUT
 THE
 PROBLEM
 WAS
 THAT
 THE
 SENSE
 OF IMPENDING
 DEATH
 GOT IN THE
 WAY.
 NOW
 I HOPE
 YOU
 UNDERSTAND? 

ARLO
 AND
 ZONARA
 BOTH
 NODDED,
 BARELY
 PERCEPTIBLY
 - THEY
 FELT
 THAT
 SUCH
 AN EXPLANATION
 BASICALLY
 EXHAUSTED
 THE
 MECHANISM
 OF THE
 MAD
 BREEDER'S
 WORKINGS. 
- FELISTER
 HAD
 PLANNED
 TO TRANSFER
 HIS
 CONSCIOUSNESS
 TO ONE
 OF THE
 OTHER
 BODIES,
 BUT
 FAILED,
 AND
 THEN
 THAT
 THING
 HAPPENED
 WITH
 THE
 DEMON
 THAT
 YOU
 ALREADY
 KNOW
 ALL
 TOO
 WELL
 ABOUT
 - IT TRANSFERRED
 INTO
 THE
 GAS
 BENZOUR
 ITSELF,
 AND
 YOU
 HAD
 TO GO THROUGH
 ALL
 THAT.
 THE
 WHOLE SITUATION
 WAS
 THAT
 NO MATTER
 HOW
 WELL-
HONED
 HIS
 BRILLIANT
 DESIGN
 WAS,
 SOMETHING
 JUST
 DIDN'T
 FIT.
 PERHAPS
 HE HAD
 DEVELOPED
 AN ATTACHMENT
 TO LIFE,
 AS HE ALLOWED
 INTERNALLY
 308 
 THAT
 THERE
 WAS
 STILL
 UNFINISHED
 BUSINESS,
 AND
 HIS
 UNTIMELY
 DEATH
 WOULD
 HAVE
 CUT EVERYTHING
 SHORT.
 YOU
 REMEMBER
 THAT
 VERY
 MEANINGFUL
 QUOTE
 FROM
 SCRIPTURE
 THAT
 "THE
 LORD
 IS MY SHEPHERD;
 I SHALL
 NOT
 BE LEFT
 IN WANT.
 IN GREEN
 PASTURES
 WILL
 HE COMFORT
 ME; BESIDE
 STILL
 WATERS
 WILL
 HE LEAD
 ME.59" THIS
 PRINCIPLE
 OF SUPPLY
 IS VERY
 IMPORTANT!
 WHEN
 FELISTER
 INTERACTED
 WITH
 VARIOUS
 CRIMINALS,
 RECIDIVISTS,
 AND
 ALSO
 PROMINENT
 POLITICIANS,
 HE RESORTED
 TO THE
 SERVICES
 OF VARIOUS
 DEMONS
 WHO
 HELPED
 HIM,
 BUT NOT
 FOR
 FREE
 - HE GAVE
 THEM
 LITTLE
 PIECES
 OF HIS
 SOUL.
 BUT HOW
 MANY
 PIECES
 DOES
 THE
 HUMAN
 SOUL
 POSSE
SS - EVEN THAT
 OF A MAN
 LIKE
 FELISTER
 EMBANKS?
 SOME
 SAY
 THE
 SOUL
 IS A UNIFIED
 WHOLE,
 OTHERS
 SAY
 IT HAS
 TWO
 OR THREE
 PARTS,
 BUT
 ONE
 THING
 I CAN
 SAY
 FOR SURE
 - WE ARE ALL
 BORN
 WITH
 SEVEN LIVES
 AND
 THAT
 IS THE
 THING
 THAT
 MATTERS,
 AND
 THEN
 OUR
 SOUL
 MOVES
 ON TO ITS
 NEXT
 PHASE
 OF DEVELOPMENT. 

MAYBE
 WE WERE
 BORN
 FOR
 ANOTHER
 TIME
 AND
 ANOTHER
 PLACE
 BECAUSE
 OURS
 WAS
 IRRETRIEVABLY
 GONE
 AND
 WE WOULD
 PROBABLY
 NEVER
 REPEAT
 AND
 LIVE
 THAT
 LIFE
 AGAIN.
 THERE
 WAS
 ONLY
 A VAGUE
 MEMORY
 OF SOME
 D309 
 WISHED
 - AND
 THE
 FENTANYL
 SUBSTANCE
 VARIETIES
 WERE
 GOING
 TO HIS
 SLUSH
 FUND
 IN OFFSHORE
 ACCOUNTS
 WITH
 WHICH
 HE CARRIED
 OUT
 HIS
 PLANS.
 FOR EXAMPLE
 ... DIEGO
 WAS
 JUST
 FINISHING
 HIS
 STORY
 WHEN
 I SENSED
 SOMETHING
 WASN'T
 QUITE
 RIGHT.
 YES,
 IT HAD
 REVEALED
 TO US MOST
 OF FELISTER
'S LEGACY,
 BUT
 FROM
 HIS
 BODY
 LANGUAGE,
 ON A SUBCONSCIOUS
 LEVEL,
 I SENSED
 THAT
 SOMETHING
 WAS
 AMISS.
 HE WAS
 A MOLE!
 VILE,
 RUTHLESS
 AND
 INDIFFERENT!
 I UNBUTTONED
 HIS
 SHIRT,
 WHICH
 WAS
 STAINED
 WITH
 BLOOD
 FROM
 THE
 DEMON
 HIMSELF.
 IT WAS
 A REMINDER
 OF THE
 FIERCE
 FIGHT
 WE HAD
 TO GET
 RID
 OF HIM.
 THERE
 WERE
 SPECIAL
 MICROPHONES
 UNDERNEATH
 AND THE
 WHOLE
 CONVERSATION
 WAS
 BEING
 RECORDED
 ALL
 THIS
 TIME.
 THE
 AGENTS
 HAD
 USED
 THOSE
 STUPID
 MICROPHONES
 THAT
 YOU
 PUT
 ON YOUR
 WRIST,
 BUT
 THEY
 ALLOWED
 SERIOUS
 FREEDOM
 OF MOVEMENT,
 AND
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND
 THE
 FACT
 THAT
 THEY
 COULD
 EAVESDROP
 SO COMFORTABLY
 FROM
 A DISTANCE
 WAS
 WONDERFUL. 

OF COURSE,
 BETRAYAL
 COU
LD ALSO
 BE SEEN AS POWER,
 AND
 THAT
 POINT
 OF VIEW
 WAS
 PERHAPS
 ALSO
 PART
 OF FELISTER
'S HERITAGE.
 THE
 TRADITIONAL
 VIEW
 WAS
 THAT
 TRAITORS
 WERE
 OUR
 ENEMIES,
 AND
 WHETHER
 THAT
 WAS
 REALLY
 THE
 CASE. 
THE
 OLD
 WOMAN
 BEHIND
 THE
 BAR
 WAS
 APPARENTLY
 JUST
 ANOTHER
 INFORMANT
 FOR
 THE
 FEDS. 
AT THAT
 POINT
 THE
 FEDS
 BARGED
 IN - THEY
 WERE
 QUITE
 ENTHUSIASTIC
 ABOUT
 HAVING
 SOMETHING
 - OR AT LEAST
 FORMALLY. 
THIS
 WAS
 THE
 APPARENT
 CONFESSION
 OF DIEGO
 HIMSELF
 - STRONG
 EVIDENCE
 ACCORDING
 TO THEMSELVES. 

AGENT
 MORALES
 BRISTLED: 
310 
 - EVERYONE
 ON THE
 GROUND!
 NOBODY
 MOVE! 
AND
 SHOVED
 US DOWN
 LIKE
 RIPE
 WATERMELONS
 BRUISED
 ON THE
 FLOOR.
 AFTER
 HIM,
 THE
 OTHERS
 CAME
 IN!
 THEIR
 WEAPONS
 WERE
 DRAWN
 AND
 READY
 TO STRIKE
 THE
 TARGET
 - WHATEVER
 IT WAS! 
THE
 FEDS
 TURNED
 THE
 QUIET
 ASHGROVE
 UPSIDE
 DOWN.
 THEY
 ALSO
 RANSACKED
 THE
 HOUSE
 WHERE
 WE WERE
 STAYING.
 AND
 GENERALLY
 FOUND
 NOTHING,
 BECAUSE
 THERE
 WAS
 NOTHING
 TO FIND
 EITHER.
 IT WAS
 COMMON
 PRACTICE
 FOR THE
 FEDS
 TO ILLEGALLY
 COLLECT
 THOUSANDS
 OF CALLS,
 WHICH
 THEY
 WOULD
 THEN
 USE
 AS EVIDENCE
 AND
 ALSO
 TO ELICIT
 TESTIMON
Y. MORALES
 RUBBED
 HIS
 HANDS
 TOGETHER
 IN A WAY
 THAT
 BETRAYED
 HIS
 SATISFACTION
 THAT
 ONCE
 AND
 FOR ALL
 HE WOULD
 BE TRULY
 APPRECIATED-
BUT HE DIDN'T
 KNOW
 EVERY
 THREAD
 OF DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN'S
 STORY,
 SINCE
 FATHER
 TOBIAS
 HAD
 REMAINED
 SILENT
 ANYWAY. 
WHEN
 THE
 FEDS
 LISTENED
 TO THE
 TAPES,
 THEY
 WERE
 LEFT
 OPEN-MOUTHED
 AND
 UNABLE
 TO SAY
 ANYTHING.
 AGENT
 MORALES,
 JUST
 SCRATCHING
 BEHIND
 HIS
 EAR
 LIKE
 SOMEONE
 WHO
 HAD
 FALLEN
 INTO
 AN UNHARVESTED
 VINEYARD
 AND
 WONDERING
 HOW
 HE WAS
 GOING
 TO JUSTIFY
 THE
 PURPOSE
 OF THE
 OPERATION,
 WHICH
 INVOLVED
 NEARLY
 TWO
 DOZEN
 FEDERAL
 AGENTS,
 VEHICLES
 AND
 EQUIPMENT
 - AND
 IT WAS
 ALL
 TAXPAYER
 MONEY
 - IT SMELLED
 LIKE
 FAILURE
 TO HIM.
 A BIG
 ONE
 AT THAT!
 IT MIGHT
 EVEN HAVE
 BEEN
 THE
 END
 OF HIS
 CAREER! 
THE
 AGENTS
 EXPECTED
 TO HEAR
 SOME
 SUBSTANTIVE
 INFORMATION,
 BUT
 INSTEAD
 THERE
 WAS
 ONLY
 WHITE
 NOISE,
 WHICH
 WASN'T
 MUCH.
 IT WAS
 AS IF OUR
 WHOLE
 CONVERSATION
 HAD
 NEVER
 TAKEN
 PLACE
 AND
 THERE
 WAS
 NOTHING
 UNUSUAL
 IN IT. 
311 
 TO BE PRECISE,
 MORALES
 WAS
 AN OLD WOLF,
 AND
 NO SUPERNATURAL
 PHANTASMAGORIAS
 WERE
 LOST
 ON HIM,
 BUT
 UNLI
KE DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN,
 HE WAS
 IN NO HURRY TO DECLARE
 VICTORY,
 AS TOO MANY
 SUBMARINE
 STONES
 MIGHT
 COME
 UP IN THE
 COURSE
 OF UNRAVELING
 THE
 STORY. 
MORALES
 HAD
 HANDLED
 THE
 INVESTIGATION
 IN A VERY
 SUBTLE
 AND
 CAREFUL
 MANNER
 - HE HAD INFILTRATED
 DIEGO
 AT FELISTER'
S, AND
 FROM
 THEN
 ON THERE
 WAS
 NO NEED
 FOR TELLING,
 AND
 NOW
 THIS
 PART. 
BUT IF DIEGO
 HAD
 DONE
 THIS
 HOW
 WAS
 HE ABLE,
 POSSESSED
 BY THE
 DEMON,
 NOT
 TO BREAK
 THE
 MICROPHONE.
 THE
 QUESTION
 REMAINED
 OPEN.
 IT WAS
 OBVIOUSLY
 PURE
 LUCK!
 OR MAYBE
 NOT? 
THE
 FIRST
 DIEGO
 OR JAKE
 WAS
 ALIVE
 AND
 WELL
 - THAT
 EXPLAINED
 THE
 MYSTERY
 - DAMN!
 AND
 DIEGO
 HIMSELF
 - RAUL'S
 BROTHER
 HAD
 THOUGHT
 HE WAS
 DEAD
 WHEN
 HE POISONED
 HIM
 FROM
 THE
 GRAVE.
 AND
 THEN
 THE
 FEDS
 ARRIVED,
 RECRUITED
 HIM,
 AND
 TOOK
 JAKE TO THE
 MORGUE
 - AFTER
 ALL,
 THIS
 STORY
 SEEMED
 PLAUSIBLE.
 BUT
 HOW
 LONG
 COULD
 HIS
 BODY
 HAVE
 BEEN
 UNDERGROUND? 
MATHEMATICALLY
 CALCULATED,
 ONE
 COULD
 SPEND
 AT LEAST
 FIVE
 AND
 A HALF
 HOURS
 UNDERGROUND
 BEFORE
 THE
 AIR
 IN THE
 COFFIN
 RAN
 OUT.
 DIEGO
 HAD
 FOUGHT
 FOR
 EVERY
 BREATH
 TO GET
 OUT!
 TO BE BORN
 AGAIN!
 TO SEE THE
 LIGHT
 OF DAY!
 AND
 TO START
 ANEW! 
DIEGO
 HAD
 JUST
 MANAGED
 TO SAVE
 JAKE,
 AS HE HAD
 BEEN
 RECRUITED
 BY THE
 FEDS
 SHORTLY
 AFTER
 HE HAD
 STARTED
 HIS
 JOB
 WITH
 FELISTER. 
AS HARD
 AS IT WAS
 TO BELIEVE,
 FELISTER
 HAD
 LEFT
 SOMETHING
 BEHIND
 - TWO
 CHILDREN
 WHO
 WERE
 NOT HIS,
 BUT
 WHO
 STILL
 BREATHED
 THE
 FRESH
 AIR
 OF THIS
 EARTH.
 TWO
 CHILDREN
 WHO
 HAD
 HELPED
 TO END
 THE
 BLOODY
 TERROR
 OF THE
 FARMER! 
312 
 DETECTIVE
 MORALES
 WAS
 OBVIOUSLY
 UNHAPPY
 WITH
 THE
 WHITE
 NOISE,
 BUT
 HE DIDN'T
 KNOW
 WHAT
 TO SAY. 
THEN
 THE
 YAKUBA
 APPROACHED
 HIM.
 THE WISE
 OLD MAN
 DECIDED
 TO TALK
 TO HIM
 AND
 REVEAL
 WHAT
 HE KNEW: 

- "YOU
 MUST
 SEE
 THE
 SYMBOLS,
 AGENT
 MORALES,"
 HE COUGHED,
 "THE
 PRESENCE
 OF A RAINBOW
 IS A SIGN
 THAT
 THE
 GUARDIAN
 ANGEL
 IS WITH
 THE
 DIEGO
 - AND
 THAT'S
 NO SMALL
 THING.
 LOOK
 AT THOSE
 COLORS
 - THEY
 TELL
 YOU
 EVERYTHING.
 AND
 THE
 SOULS
 OF SOME
 WILL
 CONTINUE
 TO EXIST
 ONLY
 IN THE
 SO-CALLED
 BACKGROUND
 OF THEIR
 LIVES,
 WHERE
 THE
 OPTION
 OF LIFE,
 AND
 IN PARTICULAR
 ACCESS
 TO THEIR
 VITAL
 CORE,
 WILL
 BE CUT
 OFF.
 THIS
 IS ALSO
 CALLED
 LOSING
 TOUCH
 WITH
 YOUR
 SOUL.
 PERHAPS
 HIS
 ANTACARANA
60 HAS
 BEEN
 DAMAGED,
 BUT STILL." 
AGENT
 MORALES
 CRINGED.
 THAT
 SOUNDED
 SIMPLE...
 HE LOOKED
 AROUND
 AT THIS
 AFRICAN
 HEALER
 WITH
 A GREYING
 HEAD
 WHO
 WAS
 TRYING
 TO HELP
 HIM,
 REVEALING
 TO HIM
 THE
 MEANING
 OF EVERYTHING. 
- "AFTER
 ALL,
 THERE
 IS A TRAITOR
 IN ALL
 OF US - EVEN ON AN ENERGETIC
 LEVEL,"
 THE
 OLD MAN
 CONTINUED,
 "AND
 HAVE
 THESE
 TRAITORS
 ACTUALLY
 BETRAYED
 YOU,
 OR ARE
 THEY
 SIMPLY
 YOUR
 HELPERS
 TO THE
 HIGHER
 ENERGIES
 AND
 ARE
 NOT
 BETRAYING
 US INTO
 THE
 HANDS
 OF THE
 MOST
 HIGH?" 
AGENT
 MORALES
 ASSUM
ED THAT
 SOME
 SUPERNATURAL
 FORCES
 HAD
 INTERVENED
 IN THE
 WHOLE
 STORY
 - BUT UNLIKE
 DETECTIVE
 DONOVAN,
 HE HAD
 EARS
 TO HIS
 HEAD
 AND
 COULD
 HEAR
 AND LISTEN.
 AND
 HAD
 ENOUGH
 BRAINS
 TO JUDGE
 CLEARLY
 AND
 SOBERLY
 WHAT
 WAS
 GOING
 ON. 
                                               
 60   Antakarana is the connection between personality, soul an
d 
spirit and is also known as the spiritual bridge. 
313 
 BEHIND
 HIS
 BACK,
 THE
 TWO
 BLOODLESS
 BROTHERS
 WITH
 A COMMON
 ADOPTIVE
 FATHER
 EMBRACED.
 THEY
 COULDN'T
 BELIEVE
 THEY
 WERE
 INTERCONNECTED
 IN THEIR
 PATH. 
- EVERY
 DISAPPOINTMENT,
 AGENT
 MORALES,
 LEADS
 US TO SUBTLER
 LEVELS.
 THEN
 THERE
 WOULD
 BE NO NEED
 FOR ANY
 INVESTIGATION.
 THE
 QUESTION
 REMAINS
 DO YOU
 REALLY
 WANT
 TO LIFT
 YOUR
 SOUL? 
THE
 INVESTIGATION
 WENT
 ON FOR MONTHS,
 AND
 I WENT
 BACK
 TO THE
 OLD HAUNTS
 WITH
 THE
 AGENTS,
 EXPLAINING
 TO THEM
 THE
 INTRICACIES
 OF FELISTER
'S LEGACY.
 FINALLY,
 THE
 FBR
 JUST
 CALLED
 IT OFF AS IT SEEMED FRUITLESS,
 BUT
 NOT
 BEFORE
 CHECKING
 OUT
 THE
 CONNECTIONS
 TO THE
 POLITICIANS
 AND
 MOBSTERS
 THEY
 HAD
 SOME
 LEADS
 ON ANYWAY.
 AGENT
 MORALES
 DECIDED
 NOT
 TO MEDDLE
 IN THE
 WORK
 OF THE
 ALMIGHTY
 - WAS
 IT RIGHT
 OR WRONG?
 WELL,
 EVERYONE
 WAS
 TO JUDGE
 FOR
 THEMSELVES. 
AFTER
 DIGGING
 DEEPER
 INTO
 THE
 MAD
 FARMER'S
 SECRETS,
 IT TURNED
 OUT
 THAT
 HE DID
 INDEED
 HAVE
 SUBSTANTIAL
 AMOUNTS
 OF MONEY
 IN HIS
 OFFSHORE
 COMPANY. 

SIMPLE
 STATEMENTS
 SHOWED
 THAT
 IF JAKE
 HAD OWNED
 ABOUT
 TWO
 MILLION
 DOLLARS
 (IT
 WAS
 WORTH
 NOTING
 THAT
 HE WAS
 NOT
 PROSECUTED
 FOR
 HIS
 TREMENDOUS
 COOPERATION
 DURING
 THE
 AGENTS'
 INVESTIGATION,
 BUT
 HE WAS
 NOT
 ALLOWED
 TO TOUCH
 HIS
 FORTUNE
 - AT LEAST
 NOT
 UNTIL
 IT WAS
 ALL
 OVER!),
 THEN
 FELISTER
 WAS
 SIMPLY
 UNBEATABLE.
 WE HAD
 A DEAL
 WITH
 THE
 FEDS
 TO HAND
 OVER
 THE
 BREEDER'S
 SUMS
 TO THEM,
 BUT
 THIS
 IS WHERE
 THINGS
 WEREN'T
 SO SIMPLE. 

IT WAS
 INTERESTING
 THAT
 FELISTER
 HAD
 MADE
 AN INGENIOUS
 FINANCIAL
 SYSTEM,
 AND
 BESIDES
 BEING
 A 314 
 SKILLED
 BUSINESSMAN,
 HE WAS
 A GOOD ENOUGH
 FINANCIER. 

ONE
 PART
 WAS
 THAT
 HE OWNED
 PHANTOM
 COMPANIES
 THAT
 WERE
 HIDDEN
 BEHIND
 A SERIES
 OF OFFSHORE
 COMPANIES
 THAT
 WERE
 IN TURN
 PARTNERS
 OF INDIANS
 WHO
 OWNED
 FUNERAL
 AGENCIES
 THAT
 BURIED
 DEAD
 INDIANS
 ON RESERVATIONS
 ON BOTH
 SIDES
 OF THE
 BORDER
 - AND
 SINCE
 A COFFIN
 COULD
 HIDE
 AT LEAST
 TWENTY
 POUNDS
 OF PURE
 GOODS,
 THAT
 MADE
 FABULOUS
 SUMS
 IN THE
 THIRTY
 MILLI
ON RANGE.
 YES, THAT'S
 RIGHT!
 IT WAS
 PURE
 FENTANYL,
 AND
 FELISTER
 LIKED
 HIS
 BEST
 TO GO TO HIS
 MOST
 DEVOTED
 CUSTOMERS
 HIS
 CUSTOMERS.
 SOMETIMES
 HE CARRIED
 TWO
 COFFINS
 A YEAR
 ACROSS
 THE
 BORDER,
 AND
 THAT
 THROUGH
 THIS
 CHANNEL
 ALONE. 
BUT THE
 FINANCIAL
 PART
 OF ORGANIZED
 CRIMINAL
 PROFIT
 DIVERSION
 COULD
 EMBARRASS
 EVEN HARVARD-EDUCATED
 YUPPIES. 
WITH
 SOME
 OF THE
 MONEY,
 DONATIONS
 WERE
 MADE
 TO CHURCHES
 THAT
 WERE
 AGAIN
 CONNECTED
 WITH
 HIM
 IN SOME
 DEGREE,
 AND
 THEY
 MADE
 A CAMPAIGN
 OF DONATIONS,
 AND
 THE
 MONEY
 CAME
 BACK
 TO THE
 INDIANS
 AGAIN
 IN VARIOUS
 FORMS-WELL,
 NOT
 ALL,
 BUT STILL
 FELISTER
'S IDEA
 WAS
 STRAIGHT
 CONCRETE!
 EVEN IF HE LOST,
 IN THE
 FORM
 OF VARIOUS
 FEES
 AND
 BRIBES,
 ABOUT
 THIRTY
 PER CENT,
 THE
 OTHER
 SEVENTY
 REMAINED
 TO HIM.
 THE
 SHOW
 GOT
 EVEN
 BIGGER
 WHEN
 THE
 ELECTION
 CAMPAIGNS
 OF CONGRESSMEN
 AND
 EVEN SOME
 SENATORS
 STARTED
 - FELISTER
 OWNED
 TWO
 WHOLE
 ONES,
 WHO
 INCIDENTALLY
 PAID
 HIM
 BACK
 HANDSOMELY
 IN THE
 FORM
 OF LOBBYING,
 BUT
 THERE
 WERE
 ALSO
 SOME
 MORE
 COMPLICATED
 INTERCONNECTIONS
 - BORN
 IN HIS
 BRILLIANT
 HEAD,
 SUCH
 AS LAUNDERING
 SOME
 OF HIS
 MONEY. 
DETECTIVE
 MORALES
 KNEW
 WELL
 THAT
 SOME
 OF THE
 THINGS
 WERE
 HARD
 TO PROVE
 AND
 HAD
 TO TINKER
 315 
 DIRECTLY
 WITH
 THE
 CHURCH DIOCESES,
 WHICH
 HE DIDN'T
 LIKE.
 IF THERE
 WAS
 EVEN THE
 SLIGHTEST
 SUCKERPUNCH,
 OR MORE
 ACCURATELY
 IF HIS
 ACTIONS
 LOOKED
 LIKE
 THE
 TINIEST
 FAILURE,
 HE WOULD
 SIMPLY
 BE RUINED.
 THE
 DIOCESES
 OF THE
 CHURCH WERE
 UNDER
 SPECIAL
 JURISDICTION,
 WHICH
 MEANT
 IT WASN'T
 A GOOD IDEA
 TO INVESTIGATE
 A FELISTER
 RIGHT
 THERE.
 BY COMMON
 CONSENT,
 FAITH
 WAS
 NOT
 NEGOTIABLE.
 AND
 COULD
 NOT
 MEASURE
 THAT
 JURISDICTION
 BY THE
 STANDARDS
 OF ITS OWN
 JURISDICTION.
  THE
 LIST
 OF CHURCHES
 IN THE
 UNITED
 STATES
 OF AMERICA
 WAS
 ALMOST
 ENDLESS,
 AND
 FELISTER
 HAD
 MANAGED
 TO SQUEEZE
 INTO
 EVERY
 ONE
 OF THEM.
 IT WAS
 A VERITABLE
 TAX
 HAVEN
 OUT
 THERE,
 AND
 IF A PARTICULARLY
 ENTERPRISING
 BUSINESSMAN
 LIKE
 MR.
 EMBANKS
 HAD
 DEVELOPED
 A DEFENSIVE
 STRATEGY
 - THIS
 WAS
 THE
 PERFECT
 PLACE
 TO IMPLEMENT
 IT.
 IF WE HAD
 TO BE SPECIFIC
 ABOUT
 THOSE
 ORGANIZATIONS
 THAT
 WERE
 EXEMPT
 FROM
 INCOME
 TAX
 UNDER
 IRS
 CODE
 SECTION
 501(A).
 THE
 SITUATION
 WAS
 PARTICULARLY
 AMUSING
 WITH
 THE
 CATHOLIC
 PRIESTS
 AS THEY
 WERE
 QUITE
 SUSCEPTIBLE
 IN THIS
 REGARD
 - THEY
 WERE
 EXCELLENT
 COLLABORATORS
 WITH
 THE
 BRUTAL
 BREEDER
 AND
 HE PROFITED
 HANDSOMELY
 FROM
 THEM
 AS WELL.
 FELISTER
 WAS
 A SUBTLE
 PSYCHOLOGIST
 AND
 UNDERSTOOD
 HOW
 THIS
 DEPRAVED
 WORLD
 WORKED
 - IT WAS
 THE
 SAME
 SLOP
 WHERE
 HE CAME
 FROM. 
AGENT
 MORALES
 COULD
 SEE
 ALL
 THE
 FALSENESS
 ALL
 AROUND,
 BUT HIS
 PROFESSIONAL
 PRINCIPLES
 MADE
 HIM
 STICK
 TO THE
 ORDERS
 HE HAD
 RECEIVED
 FROM
 ABOVE.
 HE WAS
 EVEN THINKING,
 NOW
 THAT
 HE WAS
 DONE,
 OF JUST RETIRING
 - ONCE
 AND
 FOR ALL.
 MORALES
 WAS
 FAR
 FROM
 BEING
 A FIRST
 YOUTH,
 AND
 HE KNEW
 THAT
 THOSE
 CHERISHED
 TWENTY-SEVEN
 OR SO YEARS
 OF FEDERAL
 SERVICE
 HAD
 TO BE COVERED
 IN ORDER
 TO COUNT
 ON SOME
 SORT
 OF PENSION
 OF 316 
 FOUR
 OR FIVE
 THOUSAND
 DOLLARS
 A MONTH-
YES, IT WASN'T
 BAD.
 BUT,
 WAS
 HE EVER GOING
 TO LIVE
 TO FINISH
 THIS
 CASE
 TOO. 
AT FIRST,
 THOUGH
 PROFOUND,
 THE
 AFRICAN
 HEALER'S
 REASONING
 DID
 NOT
 SEEM TO HIM
 TO BE OF MUCH
 USE
 IN UNRAVELLING
 THE
 MYSTERY,
 BUT
 APPARENTLY
 HE SIMPLY
 HAD
 TO CHANGE
 HIS
 THINKING
 - THIS
 WAS A BASIC
 RULE
 IN THE
 WORK
 OF ANY
 PROFESSIONAL. 
"DON'T
 WE ALL
 STRIVE
 FOR THE
 LIGHT

 MUSED
 AGENT
 MORALES,
 "AND
 IT IS OUR
 PURPOSE
 TO DISCOVER
 WHAT
 A MAN
 IS THINKING
 EVEN BY LOOKING
 AT HIS
 LIPS!
 BEHAVIORAL
 PSYCHOLOGISTS
 HAD
 CONVINCED
 US THAT
 WE COULD
 TELL
 A REAL
 SMILE
 FROM
 A FAKE
 ONE,
 BUT NO ONE
 HAD
 TAUGHT
 US HOW
 TO READ
 THE
 SOUL
 IN THE
 AFTERLIFE!" 
WE HADN'T
 BEEN
 TO ASHGROVE
 FOR A LONG
 TIME
 - THAT
 LITTLE
 COMMUNITY
 IRRITATED
 MY PSYCHE
 WITH
 ITS
 EMPTINESS
 AND
 LACK
 OF PERSPECTIVE,
 AND
 MOST
 OF ALL
 WITH
 THE
 HYPOCRISY
 OF ITS
 DECORUM,
 WHICH
 WAS
 DESIGNED
 TO CATCH
 OUT
 THE
 GULLIBLE
 OR PEOPLE
 WHO,
 JUST
 LIKE
 US,
 WANTED
 TO GET
 THE
 JOB
 DONE,
 AND
 MILBETH
 SARDON
 HAD
 GIVEN
 THEM
 HER
 INPUT
 IN THE
 WIRETAPPING
 - SHE
 HAD
 RECORDED
 US WITH
 A SPECIAL
 TAPE
 RECORDER,
 AND
 IN RETURN
 THE
 FEDS
 HAD
 PROMISED
 TO SETTLE
 HER
 WITH
 A SMALL
 PENSION
 - ESPECIALLY
 AFTER
 HER
 COMPLAINT
 THAT
 THIS
 PLACE
 JUST
 WASN'T
 GOING
 AND
 SHE
 HAD
 EVEN SUNK
 CREDITS
 TO KEEP
 IT GOING.
  I WON'T
 GO INTO
 DETAILS,
 BUT
 I DO RECALL
 THAT
 FELISTER
 WAS
 MAKING
 A HEALTHY
 PROFIT
 FROM
 USURY
 AS WELL
 - AND
 IT WAS
 MASKED
 IN A HELLISHLY
 VILE
 AND
 IMMORAL
 WAY.
 THAT
 FARMER'S
 BASTARD
 AND INFERNAL
 SON
 OF A BITCH!
 FOR A LONG
 TIME,
 THIS
 BUSINESS
 WAS
 KNOWN
 AS THE
 DEVIL'S
 BUSINESS! 
317 
 FELISTER
 WOULD
 BUY BACK
 NON-REPAYABLE
 LOANS
 FROM
 LARGE
 FINANCIAL
 INSTITUTIONS
 AND
 THEN
 FORCE
 THE
 DEBTORS
 TO WORK
 IN ONE
 OF HIS
 CRIMINAL
 SCHEMES,
 WHERE
 THEY
 WERE
 TECHNICALLY
 SUPPOSEDLY
 ON SALARY,
 BUT IN FACT
 WERE
 FORCED
 TO WITHDRAW
 - THIS
 TIME
 QUITE
 LEGALLY
 - SERIOUS
 SUMS
 OF MONEY
 - ALTHOUGH
 NOT
 VERY
 ORIGINAL
 IT ALSO
 BROUGHT
 HIM
 A SERIOUS
 INCOME,
 WITH
 WHICH
 HE MAINLY
 MAINTAINED
 THE
 ILLUSION
 OF THE
 FARMING
 IDYLL
 AND
 CARRIED
 OUT
 VARIOUS
 "ECO"
 PROJECTS
 AROUND
 THE
 FARM
 - SUCH
 AS WIND
 TURBINES,
 FROM
 WHICH
 HE AGAIN
 MADE
 SERIOUS
 MONEY,
 AS HE COULD
 ALSO
 SELL
 TO HIS
 NEIGHBOURS
 WHO
 WERE
 ALSO
 EMPLOYEES
 OF THE
 FARM
 - FELISTER
 COULD
 EVEN BUILD
 A SMALL
 TOWN
 LARGE
 ENOUGH
 TO HOLD
 A POPULATION
 OF TWO
 THOUSAND,
 BUT HE PREFERRED
 TO DISPERSE
 THE
 CONSUMPTION
 BETWEEN
 SEVERAL
 UNCONNECTED
 COMMUNITIES
 THAT
 HE HIMSELF
 HAD
 CREATED
 AND
 POPULATED
 - HE JUST
 DIDN'T
 WANT
 ANYONE
 SNOOPING
 AROUND
 THE
 FARM
 AND
 CAUSING
 HIM
 TROUBLE
 FROM
 AT LEAST
 TEN
 MILES
 AWAY,
 AS THIS
 WAS
 HIS
 WORLD!
 AND
 HERE
 HIS
 LAWS
 APPLIED!
 THE
 MAIN
 OBSTACLE
 TO THE
 EXECUTION
 OF THE
 CONCEPTUAL
 DESIGN
 WAS
 NOT
 SO MUCH
 TECHNICAL,
 BUT PROVING
 THE
 COMMON
 USE
 OF THE
 POWER,
 SINCE
 OTHERWISE
 THE
 AUTHORITIES
 WOULD
 HAVE
 STOPPED
 THE
 WHOLE
 ENTERPRISE
 - THAT
 IS,
 FELISTER
 HAD
 TO RESORT
 TO THE
 SERVICES
 OF A POWERFUL
 TRUST
 TO PROVIDE
 HIM
 WITH
 THE
 TECHNICAL
 DESIGN,
 AND
 THEN
 TO A WHOLE
 COHORT
 OF LAWYERS
 WHO
 DEALT
 WITH
 POWER
 MATTERS. 
HE SOLD
 THEM
 A HUGE
 AMOUNT
 OF THE
 ELECTRICITY
 HE WAS
 GENERATING
 WITH
 THEIR
 MONEY.
  A SIMPLE
 WIND
 TURBINE
 HAD
 THE
 CAPACITY
 TO PRODUCE
 AT LEAST
 A MEGAWATT
 AND
 A HALF
 OF ELECTRICITY
 - AND
 THAT
 WAS
 ASSUMING
 THE
 WIND
 SPEED WAS
 WITHIN
 TWENTY-FIVE
 MILES
 A PART,
 AND
 THERE
 WERE
 OVER
 A HUNDRED
 TURBINES
 NEAR
 THE
 FARM,
 AND
 YET THEIR
 318 
 NOISE
 DID NOT
 DISTURB
 THE
 ANIMALS
 - THE
 PIGS
 THEMSELVES
 COULD
 WALK
 FREELY
 AMONG
 THEM.
 THE
 ELECTRICITY
 PRODUCED
 BY ONE
 ALONE
 WAS
 QUITE
 SUFFICIENT
 TO SUPPLY
 ONE
 THOUSAND
 FIVE
 HUNDRED
 HOUSEHOLDS-THAT
 IS TO SAY,
 TWO
 TURBINES
 WERE
 AMPLY
 SUFFICIENT
 TO SUPPLY
 THE
 NEEDS
 OF
 THE
 FARM
 AND THE
 ADJOINING
 UNCONNECTED
 COMMUNITIES,
 AND
 THE
 POWER
 THAT
 WAS
 GENERATED
 BY THE
 REMAINING
 NINETY-EIGHT
 WAS
 DISTRIBUTED
 THROUGH
 THE
 ELECTRIC
 GRID.
 BUT
 FOR THE
 CRAZY
 FARMER,
 THIS
 DUPLICITY
 WAS
 PERFECTLY
 IN ORDER.
 IF A CURIOUS
 PERSON
 DID
 SHOW
 UP, WHICH
 HAD
 HAPPENED
 EXACTLY
 ONCE
 OR TWICE,
 THE
 HISPANIC
 WORKERS
 GREETED
 HIM
 WITH
 ANGRY
 AND
 FRANTIC
 SHOUTS: 

- 319 
 HIS
 MIGHT
 DURING
 HIS
 LIFETIME
 - "AND
 EVEN IF SOME
 ACCUSE
 ME OF HYPOCRISY
 - IT WILL
 BE SO AS LONG
 AS THE
 WORLD
 LASTS!" 
WE BOTH
 STOOD
 AND
 WATCHED
 THE
 WONDERFUL
 OVERFLOW
 OF THE
 SKY.
 OVER
 THE
 ENDLESS
 LUSH
 GREEN
 GRASSES
 THAT
 COULD
 BE SEEN IN THE
 DISTANCE,
 SWAYED
 BY THE
 GENTLE
 TOUCHES
 OF THE
 WIND
 THAT
 SEEMED TO CARESS
 THEM,
 FOLLOWED
 AN INTERMEDIATE
 STREAK
 OF GOLDEN
 ORANGE
 THAT
 SEEMED TO SYMBOLIZE
 ALL
 FIRE
 AND
 BRIMSTONE,
 THROUGH
 WHICH
 WE HAD
 TO PASS
 IN OUR
 EARTHLY
 LIVES,
 AND
 ABOVE
 IT,
 AS IF LOWERED
 BY AN ALMIGHTY
 HAND,
 WAS
 SEEN A MASSIVE
 MASS
 OF GREYISH
 BLUISH
 CLOUDS,
 WHICH
 PERHAPS
 SOUGHT
 TO CRUSH
 IT ALL,
 OR PLUNGE
 IT INTO
 OBLIVION!
 WE STOOD
 GAZING
 THUS,
 AND
 FELISTER
 TURNED
 TO ME: 
- MY DEAR
 ELIZANDER,
 NO MATTER
 WHAT
 YOU
 DO OR DON'T
 DO IN THIS
 LIFE
 - ONE
 DAY
 IT WILL
 ALL
 BE OVER,
 BUT TRY
 TO WALK
 YOUR
 PATH
 WITH
 DIGNITY
 - AT LEAST
 FORMALLY.
 UNTIL
 THEN,
 YOU
 WILL
 WAIT
 AND
 HOPE
 THAT
 THE
 NEXT
 TIME
 THE
 CARDS
 ARE
 DEALT,
 YOU
 ARE
 NO MORE
 SCREWED
 - IF EVER! 
DETECTIVE
 MORALES
 WENT
 THROUGH
 A SIMILAR
 PERIOD,
 REALIZING
 THAT
 SOMETHING
 WAS
 ELUDING
 HIM.
 YES,
 THEY
 HAD
 FOUND
 MANY
 CLUES
 AND
 REACHED
 SERIOUS
 REVELATIONS
 ABOUT
 FELISTER
'S ABUSES
 IN THE
 LABOR
 UNIONS,
 HIS
 ILLEGAL
 ANNEXATION
 OF FARMLAND
 THAT
 HE USED
 FOR ALL
 SORTS
 OF PURPOSES,
 HIS
 INTERFERENCE
 IN THE
 ACTIVITIES
 OF THE
 INDIAN
 BURIAL
 AGENCIES
 THAT
 RAN
 THE
 DRUG TRADE
 IN CANADA
 - BUT NOTHING
 SEEMED
 TO HAVE
 CHANGED. 

THEN
 HE TURNED
 SPECIFICALLY
 TO JAKE,
 ME - ELIZANDER
 BARNAIN,
 ZONER
 AND
 ARLO. 
320 
 - "DOES
 THIS
 MEAN
 WE'RE
 AT THE
 END
 OF OUR
 JOURNEY?
 THAT
 WE HAVE
 NOTHING
 MORE
 TO UNCOVER
 AND
 DAMAGE
 TO REPAIR,
 OR ARE
 WE JUST
 GOING
 TO REPORT
 SOME
 ACTIVITY,"
 HE UTTERED
 IN A STRANGE
 TONE,
 "I'M
 NOT
 GOING
 TO HIDE
 THAT
 YOUR
 FORMER
 BOSS
 TOOK ME ON THE
 MOST
 UNUSUAL
 TRIP
 ANYONE
 COULD
 EVER HAVE
 IN THEIR
 LIFE. 
 
CHAPTER
 TWENTY-SEVEN:
 THE
 CONGRESSMAN 
 
EVEN THOUGH
 WE WERE
 COOPERATING,
 THE
 FBI
 STILL
 HADN'T
 GOTTEN
 THEIR
 SUSPICIONS
 OFF
 OF US AND
 DECIDED
 TO DOUBLE-CHECK
 THEIR
 VERSIONS-JUST
 IN CASE.
 FEDERAL
 HEADQUARTERS
 HAD
 MOVED
 TO WASHINGTON,
 AND
 THIS
 WAS
 NECESSITATED
 MAINLY
 BY THEIR
 INCREASED
 STAFF,
 AND
 AGENT
 MORALES
 COULD
 NOT
 AFFORD
 TO HAVE
 US SPREAD
 BACK
 AND
 FORTH
 LIKE
 UNWASHED
 PANTIES.
 THE
 INTERROGATIONS
 TOOK
 PLACE
 IN ONE
 OF THEIR
 MANY
 OFFICES
 AROUND
 THE
 COUNTRY,
 WHICH
 WAS
 IN THE
 STATE
 OF WISCONSIN.
 A BASIC
 PRESUMPTION
 FOR CONDUCTING
 AN INVESTIGATION
 WAS
 WHETHER
 ANY
 FEDERAL
 LAW HAD
 BEEN
 VIOLATED,
 AND
 EVEN
 THE
 ROOKIES
 IN THAT
 SECTOR
 KNEW
 IT.
 BECAUSE
 FELISTER
'S CRIMES
 WERE
 OF A DIFFERENT
 ORDER
 OF MAGNITUDE
 - THEY
 ALSO
 HAD
 A DIFFERENT
 INVESTIGATIVE
 STATUS.
 AGENT
 MORALES
 REASONED
 SOBERLY
 ENOUGH
 TO REALIZE
 THAT,
 FOR
 ONE
 REASON
 OR ANOTHER,
 A GOOD NUMBER
 OF THE
 CRIMES
 COULD
 NOT
 BE REOPENED
 BECAUSE
 SOME
 OF THEM
 HAD
 LIMITED
 FIVE-YEAR
 INVESTIGATIVE
 STATUS.
 THERE
 IT WAS
 AS IF EVERYTHING
 STARTED
 ALL
 OVER
 AGAIN
 AND
 THE
 QUESTIONS
 WERE
 ENDLESS.
 BUT
 AT SOME
 POINT
 THE
 IDEA
 OCCURRED
 TO HIM
 THAT
 THE BANK
 FRAUDS
 HAD
 A LONGER
 LIMITATION
 PERIOD
 OF TEN
 YEARS
 AFTER
 ALL
 - HERE
 HE COULD
 DIG
 INTO
 FELISTER
'S 321 
 SHIFTY
 AFFAIRS
 INVOLVING
 THE
 BAD
 LOANS
 AND THE
 WHOLE
 CHAIN
 OF BUSINESS
 VENTURES
 THEREAFTER,
 AND
 IT WAS
 ONE
 HELL
 OF AN OPPORTUNITY
 TO SAVE
 THE
 WHOLE
 INVESTIGATION
 AND
 HIS
 CAREER.
 ON SECOND
 THOUGHT,
 HE COULD
 HAVE
 TIED
 THEM
 IN SOME
 FORM
 TO FELISTER
'S OFFSHORE
 COMPANIES,
 AND
 HENCE
 HIS
 POLITICAL
 CONNECTIONS
 TO CONGRESSMEN
 AND
 SENATORS.
 YEAH,
 SOMETHING
 COULD
 HAVE
 COME
 OF THAT!
 AGENT
 MORALES
 WAS
 GUIDED
 BY FBR'S
 FIRST
 KEY
 VALUE
 - RESPECT!
 HOWEVER,
 HE HAD
 TO CHECK
 WITH
 HIS
 COLLEAGUES
 IN THE
 OPERATIONAL
 TECHNOLOGY
 DIVISION,
 ALSO
 KNOWN
 AS THE
 ED,
 WHERE
 THEY
 COULD
 PROVIDE
 HIM
 WITH
 SOME
 MORE
 INFORMATION
 - PARTICULARLY
 ON THE
 ADVANCED
 ELECTRONIC
 INTELLIGENCE
 AND
 RECONNAISSANCE
 PART.
 THEN
 SOME
 CONGRESSMAN
 FROM
 SALT
 LAKE
 CITY
 CALLED
 TO SAY
 HE HAD SOMETHING
 IMPORTANT
 TO TELL
 US - NATURALLY
 THIS
 COULD
 GET
 ZONARA
 IN TROUBLE,
 AS SHE
 HAD
 CONNECTIONS
 IN THAT
 CITY
 HERSELF.
 AGENT
 MORALES
 WAS
 THE
 MAN
 ON THE
 SPOT,
 HOWEVER,
 AND
 WE HOPED
 HE WOULD
 AT LEAST
 ACKNOWLEDGE
 HER
 MERITS
 IN THE
 INVESTIGATION
 SO FAR. 
WHEN
 WE WENT
 TO THIS
 CITY,
 ACCOMPANIED
 BY A COHORT
 OF FEDERAL
 AGENTS,
 THE
 CONGRESSMAN
 WAS
 HAVING
 A MOST
 RELAXED
 LUNCH
 AT A FANCY
 AND
 EXPENSIVE
 RESTAURANT
 - AGENT
 MORALES
 HAD
 PROMISED
 ZONARA
 THAT
 IF SHE
 COOPERATED,
 AND
 FOR THAT
 MATTER,
 ANY
 POSSIBLE
 CHARGES
 IN CONNECTION
 WITH
 FELISTER
 EMBANKS
 WOULD
 BE DROPPED
 AND
 IT WOULD
 ALL
 BE OVER
 ONCE
 AND
 FOR ALL. 

THE
 CONGRESSMAN'S
 NAME
 WAS
 CANDOR
 BRUSHFIELD
62 AND
 HE WAS
 KNOWN
 FOR HIS
 LOBBYIST
 VIEWS.
 HE SPOKE
 VERY
 MODERATELY
 AND
                                                
 62   Candor in English means frankness and directness. 
322 
 PROFESSIONALLY
 AND
 WAS
 GENERALLY
 AN ODD
 BIRD.
 FOR CONSIDERATIONS,
 SUGGESTED
 THAT
 WE MEET
 IN A NEUTRAL
 PLACE
 WHERE
 THERE
 WOULD
 BE NO UNDUE RISK
 TO HIS
 OWN
 SAFETY. 
AND
 THIS
 WAS
 PRECISELY
 HIS
 PRIVATE
 RESIDENCE,
 WHERE
 I ASSUMED
 HE WOULD
 HAVE
 OF THE
 SO-CALLED
 ANTI-EAVESDROPPING
 PLUGS.
 I HAD
 NO DOUBT
 THAT
 THERE
 WERE
 WAYS
 TO DETECT
 HIDDEN
 WEIRLES
 CAMERAS,
 LISTENING
 DEVICES
 AND
 WHATNOT
 IN HIS
 MANSION!
 BUT
 WE ALSO
 HAD
 SOME
 TRUMP
 CARDS
 UP OUR
 SLEE
VE. AFTER
 GOING
 TO A GORGEOUS
 VILLA
 HIGH
 ABOVE
 SALT
 LAKE
 CITY,
 WE SAW
 HIS
 GLAMOROUS
 MANSION.
 THERE
 WERE
 TWO
 BEAUTIFUL
 MARBLE
 STATUES
 JUST
 OUTSIDE
 THE
 ENTRANCE
 - ONE
 SYMBOLISING
 LOVE
 AND
 THE
 OTHER
 HOPE.
 I WONDERED
 IF THEY
 EVEN HAD THEM
 BOTH?
 AFTER
 THE
 INITI
AL CURT INTRODUCTION,
 WHICH
 LASTED
 NO MORE
 THAN
 A MINUTE,
 HE BEGAN
 TO INFORM
 US OF SOME
 JUICY
 DETAILS
 SURROUNDING
 HIS
 RELATIONSHIP
 WITH
 THE
 GENIUS
 BREEDER: 
- FELISTER
 ACTUALLY
 SUPPORTED
 ME BACK
 WHEN
 I RAN
 FOR JUNIOR
 CONGRESSMAN.
 YOU
 KNOW,
 IT'S
 A REALLY
 LONG
 ROAD
 AND
 ... I WAS
 LONELY
 AND
 THIS
 WAS
 THE
 CHANCE
 OF A LIFETIME.
 THAT
 JUNIOR
 SENATE
 PROGRAM
 THAT
 ...
 HE HAD
 TO PROVIDE
 ME WITH
 EXTRA
 FACILITIES
 AS WELL
 BECAUSE
 I DIDN'T
 COME
 FROM
 A VERY
 RICH
 FAMILY
 AND
 THE
 SO-CALLED
 USSYP
 DIDN'T
 COVER
 EVERYTHING
 I NEEDED,
 BUT
 HE SAW
 SOME
 POTENTIAL
 IN ME ... 
STRANGE
 WHY,
 BUT
 HE SPOKE
 WITH
 SOME
 SPECIFIC
 SLUR
 WHICH
 CONFUSED
 ME A BIT.
 THE
 MEETING
 WAS
 SUPPOSED
 TO BE JUST
 ZONARA,
 BUT I REMEMBERED
 THAT
 THE
 CONGRESSMAN
 REMEMBERED
 ME FROM
 THAT
 TIME
 ZONARA
 HAD
 ASKED
 HIM
 FOR HELP.
 YEAH,
 THAT
 SON
 OF A BITCH
 HAD
 IT COMING! 
323 
 ZONARA
 FOLLOWED
 THE
 AGENTS'
 PRIOR
 INSTRUCTIONS
 NOT
 TO INTERRUPT
 HIM
 OR CREATE
 UNNECESSARY
 HYPE
63 DURING
 THE
 CONVERSATION
 TO PREDISPOSE
 HIM
 TO SPEAK
 MORE
 AND
 MORE
 OPENLY. 
THE
 FEDS
 WERE
 IN NO HURRY AT ALL
 TO OFFER
 HIM
 THE COVENANT
 DEAL
 AND
 PUT
 HIM
 IN THE
 WITNESS
 PROTECTION
 PROGRAM
 - FIRST
 THEY
 HAD
 TO HEAR
 IF HE COULD
 REALLY
 PROVIDE
 THEM
 WITH
 VALUABLE
 AND
 SERIOUS
 INFORMATION
 ABOUT
 THE
 FARMER'S
 FINANCIAL
 AFFAIRS. 
IN THE
 COURSE
 OF THE
 CONVERSATION,
 I WAS
 ABLE
 TO GAUGE
 THE
 STATE
 OF MIND
 OF OUR
 INTERLOCUTOR,
 WHO
 WAS
 GENERALLY
 EMOTIONALLY
 BURDENED
 BY THIS
 PART
 OF HIS
 PAST,
 BUT
 ACTED
 LIKE
 SOMEONE
 WHO
 WAS
 COMPLETELY
 IMPERVIOUS
 - THIS
 WAS
 A BIT
 DISCONCERTING,
 AS THERE
 WAS
 SOME
 POSSIBILITY
 THAT
 HE WAS
 TRYING
 TO DRAW
 US INTO
 HIS
 GAM
E, WHICH
 HE HAD
 MASTERED
 IN THE
 TWENTY-FIVE
 YEARS
 SINCE
 HE HAD
 RISEN
 TO SENIOR
 CONGRESSMAN. 
- "OFFSHORE
 COMPANIES
 AREN'T
 EXACTLY
 NEW,"
 HE BEGAN
 DISTANTLY,
 "BUT
 FELISTER
 HAD
 MASTERED
 THE
 SKILL
 OF TOUCHING
 MORE
 DELICATELY
 AND
 MAINTAINING
 A KIND
 OF WEB
 OF MYSTIFICATION
 THAT
 WOULD
 HELP
 HIM
 REMAIN
 INCONSPICUOUS
 - AT LEAST
 FOR LONG
 ENOUGH.
 INSTEAD

 INCIDENTALLY
 ALMOST
 TWO-THIRDS
 OF THE

 - HE HAD CHOSEN
 MUCH
 DEEPER
 AND
 QUIETER
 WAYS
 OF HIDING
 HIS
 FINANCIAL
 RECEIPTS,
 BECAUSE
 HE WANTED
 TO AVOID

 YOU
 SEE, EVEN
 WITH
 THE

- "WHERE'S
 THE
 DIFFERENCE
?," ZONARA
 ASKED,
 SOMEHOW
 WORRIED
 IF SHE
 WAS
 VIOLATING
 THE
 INSTRUCTIONS
 GIVEN
 TO HER
 BY THE
 AGENTS
 - AT LEAST
 THAT'S
 WHAT
 YOU
 COULD
 TELL
 BY HER
 EXPRESSION,
 BUT
 I KEPT
 REMEMBERING
 THAT
 SHE
 WAS
 JUST
 FOLLOWING
 THE
 RULES
 OF THE
 GAME. 
- "WELL,
 LOOK,
 WE'RE
 GETTING
 INTO
 SOME
 PRETTY
 SPECIFIC
 AND
 SUBTLE
 STUFF,"
 THE
 CONGRESSMAN,
 WHO
 WAS
 A LAW
 AND
 ECONOMICS
 GRADUA
TE AND HAD
 EARNED
 HIS
 PHD
 FROM
 RUTGERS
 UNIVERSITY
 IN NEW
 JERSEY,
 WAS
 SNIFFING
 THE
 GROUND.
 - "LET'S
 LOOK
 AT THIS
 FROM
 A PURELY
 PRAGMATIC
 POINT
 OF VIEW
 - IF YOU
 OPERATE
 LARGE
 BUSINESSES
 AND
 REDIRECT
 THEM
 TO COUNTRIES
 THAT
 ARE
 NOT
 SO POPULAR
 FOR INVESTMENT
 AND ARE
 NOT
 ON THE
 SO-CALLED
 BLACKLIST

 ALSO

 YOU
 WILL
 BE IN TAX

 THAT
 WILL
 NOT
 BE BOMBARDED
 WITH
 CALLS
 FOR URGENT
 TAX
 REFORMS.
 AND
 HERE
 COMES
 THE
 EVEN MORE
 SPECIAL
 POINT
 - INSTEAD
 OF PAYING
 HUGE
 SUMS
 IN TAXES
 AND
 VARIOUS
 FEES,
 YOU
 REGISTER
 THE
 PARENT
 COMPANY
 IN COUNTRIES
 SUCH
 AS MONGOLIA,
 LATVIA
 OR ESTONIA,
 OR EVEN IN A COUNTRY
 THAT
 IS A LITTLE-KNOWN
 ISLAND
 ARCHIPELAGO,

 OF THE

 THERE,
 BECAUSE
 THE
 SAME

 HAS
 LENT
 YOU

 ..." 
- "RAISING

 ZONARA
 HASTENED
 TO SPECIFY
 WITH
 A WELL-DISGUISED
 SMILE. 
- "FOR
 EXAMPLE,"
 LAUGHED
 THE
 CONGRESSMAN
 - "INGENIOUSLY
 SIMPLE
 AND
 WORKABLE."
 - "EXCEPT
 THAT
 THE
 PARENT
 COMPANY,
 REGISTERED
 IN AN OFFSHORE
 TERRITORY,
 BUT NOT
 OFFICIALLY
 KNOWN
 325 
 AS SUCH,
 HAS
 AN IMPLICIT
 OWNER,
 BEHIND
 WHICH
 ARE
 OTHER
 - INDEED
 OFFSHORE
 - COMPANIES,
 REGISTERED,
 FOR EXAMPLE,
 IN THE
 VIRGIN
 ISLANDS
 OR IN SOME
 INTERESTING
 DESTINATION,
 AND
 PART
 OF THE
 OWNERSHIP
 MAY
 EVEN BE OR MAY
 BE TRANSFERRED
 TO SOME
 NON-PROFIT
 COMPANY,
 WHICH
 IS A VERY
 INTERESTING
 COINCIDENCE,
 IF YOU
 KNOW
 WHAT
 I MEAN
 - A GOOD CHOICE
 WOULD
 BE AN ADOPTION
 ORGANIZATION,
 A CHURCH, A CHARITABLE
 FOUNDATION
 OR WHATEVER
 AND
 SOMETIMES
 FELISTER
 EVEN USED
 WHAT'S
 CALLED
 A CLANDESTINE
 RE-EXPORT
 OF THEIR
 PRODUCE
 - THAT
 WAS
 PRETTY
 TRICKY,
 SINCE
 FENTANYL
 SUPPLIES
 COULD
 BE DELAYED,
 OR THEY
 JUST
 COULDN'T
 FIND
 THE
 NEW
 RECIPE
 FOR
 THE
 PRODUCT
 FAST
 ENOUGH
 WHEN
 CUSTOMER
 DEMAND
 CHANGED,
 OR THEY
 COULDN'T
 FIND
 A SKILLED
 ENOUGH
 COOK.
 THE
 POINT
 OF THESE
 CLANDESTINE
 RE-EXPORT
 OPERATIONS
 WAS
 TO ACCOUNT
 FOR
 MARKET
 CONJUNCTURE,
 AND
 FROM
 THEN
 ON IT WAS
 OF EXTREME
 CONVENIENCE
 IN THE
 VARIOUS
 CUTS
 AS WELL.
 THE
 OPERATION
 CONSISTED
 OF THE
 FOLLOWING
 - IF THE
 FENTANYL
 PRODUCED
 IN ASIA
 COULD
 NOT
 BE REALISED,
 FELISTER
 SIMPLY
 USED
 VARIOUS
 ALTERNATIVES
 OF IT AND
 THAT
 WAS
 THAT
 - THEY
 WERE
 MARKETED
 AS LOWER
 GRADE
 PRODUCTS,
 BUT THE
 FARM
 SHOULD
 NOT
 STOP
 WORKING.
 THE
 FICTITIOUS
 TRADING
 COMPANIES
 IN MEXICO
 WOULD
 BUY EVERYTHING
 AND
 THEN
 SEND
 IT BACK
 TO CANADA
 OR THE
 US.
 FELISTER
 ALSO
 HAD
 PEOPLE
 IN DEA
 SNIFFING
 OUT
 SOME
 THINGS
 FOR
 HIM.
 THEY
 WERE
 ALL
 PLAYING
 A GAME
 ONE
 WAY
 OR ANOTHER.
 THE
 CYCLE
 WAS
 ENDLESS!" 
- "BUT LET'S
 FACE
 IT - EXACTLY
 HOW
 MUCH
 DID
 FELISTER
 HAVE
?," ASKED
 ZONARA
 DIRECTLY. 
- IT WOULD
 BE DIFFICULT
 TO CALCULATE
 A FORTUNE
 SO DIVERSE,
 AS ITS
 STRUCTURE
 WAS
 INDEED
 COMPLEX
 AND
 INVOLVED
 TOO
 MANY
 STRANDS,
 AND
 ONE
 WOULD
 HAVE
 TO TAKE
 INTO
 ACCOUNT
 THE
 OVERT
 ASSETS
 AND
 326 
 LIABILITIES
 AS WELL
 AS THE
 HIDDEN
 ONES,
 BUT IN
 MY PERSONAL
 OPINION
 - PERHAPS
 OVER
 FIVE
 BILLION
 DOLLARS
 - THE
 CONGRESSMAN
 CALMLY
 EXPLAINED
 TO HER,
 STANDING
 ON THE
 OTHER
 SIDE
 OF A SMALL
 TABLE
 IN ONE
 OF THE
 HUGE
 ROOMS
 OF HIS
 MANSION,
 ONLY
 ABOUT
 TWO
 METERS
 AWAY
 FROM
 ZONARA. 
- "IT CAN'T
 BE,"
 ZONARA
 FEIGNED
 AMAZEMENT
 WITH
 THE
 PROFESSIONALISM
 OF A PROFESSIONAL
 AGENT,
 "IT'S
 EVEN MORE
 THAN
 THE
 TURNOVER
 OF SOME
 WORLD-FAMOUS
 INTERNATIONAL
 COMPANIES." 
THE
 CONGRESSMAN
 BECAME
 QUITE
 SERIOUS. 
- FELISTER
 WAS
 ACTUALLY
 OPERATING
 ON AN INTERNATIONAL
 LEVEL.
 IT IS UNLIKELY
 THAT
 MANY
 FBI
 AGENTS
 WOULD
 HAVE
 HESITATED
 TO SEEK
 HIS
 CONNECTIONS
 IN COUNTRIES
 THAT
 DID
 NOT
 EVEN
 HAVE
 A GREAT
 TRADITION
 OF DRUG TRAFFICKING,
 WHICH
 ALSO
 WORKED
 IN HIS
 FAVOUR.
 HE ALSO
 AVOIDED
 SWITZERLAND
 BECAUSE
 HE BELIEVED
 THAT,
 HOWEVER
 ISOLATED
 IT MIGHT
 BE,
 IT WOULD
 STILL
 PROVIDE
 THE
 NECESSARY
 ASSISTANCE
 TO LAW
 ENFORCEMENT
 WHEN
 ABUSE
 WAS
 TRULY
 PROVEN.
 LOCALLY,
 MR EMBANKS
 HAD
 SECURED
 ENOUGH
 SERIOUS
 SUPPORT
 - AND
 IN POLITICAL
 TERMS,
 AT THAT
 - THAT
 HE HAD NEVER
 HAD
 ANY
 MORE
 SERIOUS
 PROBLEMS.
 AT LEAST
 ONES
 THAT
 I WAS
 AWARE
 OF. PLUS,
 THE
 BASIC
 LOBBYING
 LAWS
 WERE
 ALSO
 LEGALLY
 BACKED
 BY THE
 FIRST
 AMENDMENT
 OF THE
 CONSTITUTION,
 WHICH
 GUARANTEED
 FREEDOM
 OF SPEECH,
 SO THIS
 SEEMINGLY
 SMALL
 LOOPHOLE
 UNTIED
 HIS
 HANDS
 TOO
 MUCH.
 PLUS,
 THE
 LOBBYING
 DISCLOSURE
 ACT,
 AND ITS
 AMENDMENT
 IN THE
 FORM
 OF THE
 HONEST
 LEADERSHIP
 AND
 OPEN
 GOVERNMENT
 ACT,
 REQUIRED
 ALL
 REGISTRANTS
 TO PERIODICALLY
 REPORT
 THEIR
 ACTIVITIES
 TO THE
 APPROPRIATE
 INSTITUTIONS
 - SOMETHING
 TOO CONVENIENT
 FOR
 HIS
 BUSINESSES. 
327 
 - "THAT
 SOUNDS
 QUITE
 INTERESTING,"
 CONFIRMED
 ZONARA,
 WHO
 AGREED
 WITH
 HER
 INTERLOCUTOR,
 DEMONSTRATING
 HOW
 SIMPLY
 AND
 LOGICALLY
 THE
 GENIAL
 BREEDER
 HAD
 ACTED
 TO PROTECT
 HIS
 INTERESTS. 

- "EXACTLY,"
 AGREED
 THE
 CONGRESSMAN,
 "I
 CAN'T
 AGREE
 THAT
 FELISTER
 WASN'T
 A TERRIBLY
 AMBITIOUS
 MAN!
 AND PERHA
PS HE SUCCEEDED
 IN GOING
 TOO
 FAR,
 THOUGH
 MANY
 THOUGHT
 HIM
 A SIMPLE
 AND
 LIMITED
 FARMER-
HE WAS
 ONE
 IN A BILLION!" 
- "AND
 HOW
 DID
 IT ALWAYS
 MANAGE
?," ASKED
 ZONARA
 HIS
 LAST
 QUESTION. 
- "YOU
 SEE,
 MONEY
 IS AN ILLUSION,
 AND
 THE
 MORE
 PEOPLE
 BELIEVE
 IN IT THE
 BETTER,"
 HE FINISHED,
 "AND
 FELISTER
 WAS
 A TRUE
 MASTER
 OF ILLUSIONS
 - IF YOU
 CREATE
 SOMETHING
 GOOD
 ENOUGH,
 OR MAKE
 EVERYONE
 BELIEVE
 IT IS GOOD
 ENOUGH,
 YOUR
 TASK
 WILL
 NOT
 BE WHERE
 TO GET
 THE
 MONEY,
 BUT TO CHOOSE
 FROM
 WHOM
 TO GET
 IT,
 AND
 THE
 CHOICE
 OF THE
 FORM IN WHICH
 TO DO IT IS ALSO
 A MATTER
 OF CHOICE.
 AND
 IT WORKS
 LIKE
 REAL
 MAGIC!" 
I WAS
 SURE
 THE
 FEDS
 WOULD
 HAVE
 LIKED
 THIS
 INFORMATION,
 AS IT WAS
 MORE
 THAN
 ENOUGH
 TO AT LEAST
 CONTINUE
 THE
 INVESTIGATION
 AND
 KEEP
 IT FROM
 REACHING
 A DEAD
 END,
 AND
 THUS
 MISSING
 THIS
 EXCELLENT
 OPPORTUNITY
 TO UNRAVEL
 THE
 TRUTH
 TO THE
 END.
 THE
 CONGRESSMAN
 KEPT
 HIS
 MANNER
 CASUAL,
 BUT I RECOGNIZED
 IN HIS
 FACE
 ONE
 OF THOSE
 MANY
 SUFFERERS
 WHOM
 FELISTER
 HAD
 HELPED,
 PULLING
 THEM
 OUT
 OF THE
 MIRE
 OF LIFE.
  YOU
 WILL
 ASK
 ME HOW
 I GUESSED?
 VERY
 SIMPLY.
 BY THE
 AURA
 HE GAVE
 OFF. THE
 AURA
 NEVER
 LIED! 
LAST
 TIME
 WE HAD
 SPOKEN
 TO THE
 SAME
 MAN
 AND
 HE HAD
 EXPRESSED
 A WILLINGNESS
 TO HELP
 US,
 AND
 NOW
 I WAS
 SEEING
 A COMPLETELY
 DIFFERENT
 BEING.
 AS IF I 328 
 DIDN'T
 KNOW
 HIM.
 APPARENTLY,
 EVERYTHING
 IN THIS
 WORLD
 WAS
 ABOUT
 BUSINESS
 - I MEAN
 - PERSONAL
 BUSINESS,
 AND
 HE WAS
 ABOUT
 SURVIVAL
 AND
 LIFE.
  AGENT
 MORALES'
 LONG
 HOURS
 OF TRAINING
 HAD
 BORNE
 THEIR
 FRUIT,
 AND
 NOW
 HE SAW
 CLEARLY
 THE
 SITUATION
 BEFORE
 HIM.
 HE COULD
 SENSE
 THE
 PERFECT
 SIMPLICITY
 AND
 VAST
 GENIUS
 OF FELISTER
 EMBANKS.
 BUT HOW
 HARD
 WAS
 IT REALLY
 TO BE A GOD? 

AGENT
 MORALES
 CONTINUED
 HIS TIRELESS
 MARCH
 TOWARDS
 THE
 TRUTH
 AND
 HOPED
 THAT
 IT WOULD
 ALL
 BE OVER
 AS SOON
 AS POSSIBLE.
 HE VISITED
 ALL
 THOSE
 COUNTRIES,
 SAW
 ALL
 THOSE
 CULTURES
 THAT
 FELISTER
 EMBANKS
 HAD
 INTERACTED
 WITH
 WITHOUT
 EVEN LEAVING
 THE
 CONFINES
 OF HIS
 FARM.
 IT WAS
 STRANGE
 HOW
 HE'D
 GOTTEN
 SO MANY
 SEEMINGLY
 DISPARATE
 PEOPLE
 TO DO HIS
 WORK. 
HE MUST
 HAVE
 BEEN
 USING
 MAGIC,
 OR SOME
 UNAUTHORIZED
 MEANS
 OF INFLUENCING
 OTHERS!
 MAYBE
 HE WAS
 JUST
 SOME
 UNEARTHLY
 BEING
 WHO
 HAD
 ONLY
 VISITED
 HERE
 BRIEFLY
 - BEFORE
 HE WAS
 GONE
 FOREVER! 
IN THE
 EVENING,
 AS HE LAY
 DOWN
 TO SLEEP,
 HE HAD
 A STRANGE
 DREAM
 WHICH
 WAS
 CONNECTED
 WITH
 THE
 CASE.
 HIS
 FOREHEAD
 WAS
 DRENCHED
 IN A COLD
 SWEAT
 AND
 HE WAS
 SIMPLY
 DELIRIOUS.
 HE WAS
 WALKING
 ALONG
 SOME
 MUDDY
 COUNTRY
 ROAD,
 AND
 THE
 COLOURS
 WERE
 FADING
 FROM
 RED
 TO BLACK,
 AS IF SOME
 UNSTEADY
 HAND
 WERE
 PRESSING
 THE
 RED
 OUTLINES
 INTO
 THE
 INK-BLACK
 SILHOUETTES,
 WHICH
 SEEMED HELLISHLY
 SURREAL.
 THE
 RED
 BLOOD
 WOLF
 MOON
 WAS
 GOING
 TO SINK
 INTO
 AN OCEAN
 OF DARKNESS
 AT ANY
 MOMENT.
 THE
 BLOOD-RED
 WOLF
 MOON,
 WHICH
 ACCORDING
 TO BIBLICAL
 LORE BROUGHT
 MISFORTUNE
 AND
 EVIL,
 AND
 ACCORDING
 TO SOME,
 ALMOST
 SPELLED
 THE
 APOCALYPSE,
 BUT 329 
 PERHAPS
 JUST
 MADE
 US QUESTION
 ALMOST
 EVERYTHING
 THAT
 WOULD
 SHOW
 US THE
 EXISTING
 REALITY
 FROM
 A DIFFERENT
 ANGLE.
 THE
 DUSKY
 COUNTRY
 ROAD
 CURVED
 AND
 PASSED
 BEHIND
 THE
 TREE. THE
 DREAM
 SEEMED TO HIM
 QUITE
 AS REAL.
 WHO
 KNOWS
 WHY
 HE DID
 NOT
 AVERT
 HIS
 EYES
 FROM
 THE
 ROAD,
 AS THE
 NEARBY
 GRASS
 MIGHT
 WELL
 HAVE
 BEEN
 HARBOURING
 SUNDRY
 VERMIN
 THAT
 MIGHT
 ATTACK
 HIM,
 BUT
 CONTINUED
 STEADFASTLY
 FORWARD.
 THE
 TREE
 DIDN'T
 SEEM
 TO BE TOO
 FAR
 AWAY
 - IT EVEN SEEMED TO BE WITHIN
 ARM'S
 REACH. 
AND
 YET THE
 PATH
 SEEMED
 ENDLESS.
 BUT
 HE SOON
 FOUND
 HIMSELF
 ALMOST
 BESIDE
 THE
 TREE
 ITSELF,
 AND
 A BOY
 AND
 A GIRL
 WERE
 PLAYING
 UNDER
 IT-SO IT WAS
 ELIZANDER
 AND
 JEANIE
 MAGOOD-YES,
 THE
 SAME
 JEANIE
 WHO
 WAS
 THE
 KEE
PER OF A BROTHEL
 IN NEW
 ORLEANS.
 THE
 SAME
 ONE
 WHO
 HAD
 EXPLAINED
 TO BARNAYNE
 WHAT
 A DIRTY
 AND
 BRUTAL
 THING
 LIFE
 WAS.
 BUT HOW
 SHE'D
 GOTTEN
 INTO
 ELIZANDER
 BARNAYNE'S
 HEAD
 AND
 READ
 HIS
 MIND.
 HOW
 THE
 HELL
 WAS
 THAT
 POSSIBLE?
 WAS
 HE NOT
 LOSING
 HIS
 OWN
 REASON! 

THEY
 DIDN'T
 SEEM
 TO NOTICE
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 AT ALL
 AND
 HE MADE
 ABSOLUTELY
 NO IMPRESSION
 ON THEM.
 HOW
 NA330 
 THE
 BOY
 AND
 GIRL'S
 CONVERSATION
 WAS
 NOTHING
 SPECIAL: 

- "YOU
 MEAN
 YOU'RE
 LEAVING
?," ELIZANDER
 TURNED
 TO HER,
 KICKING
 THE
 GROUND
 WITH
 HIS
 FOOT
 AS IF IN SYNC
 WITH
 HIS
 INNER
 THOUGHTS.
 - I'D
 SAY
 I'M
 GOING
 TO MISS
 YOU.
 THOSE
 FEW
 YEARS
 WHEN
 WE THOUGHT
 THE
 WHOLE
 WORLD
 WAS
 OURS
 AND
 LIVED
 EVERY
 DAY AS IF FOR THE
 LAST
 TIME.
 IT WAS
 A GOOD TIME,
 BUT
 ALSO
 KIND
 OF FAKE.
 A DISTORTED
 REALITY! 
- "THE
 WHOLE
 UNIVERSE
 IS FAKE,
 BARNAYNE,"
 JUDY RETORTED,
 "THE
 LEVEL
 OF OUR
 PERCEPTIONS
 MAKES
 IT REAL!" 
HE LOOKED
 LIKE
 SOME
 INNOCENT
 BOY,
 NOT
 A LIFE-BAKED
 TARIQA-THOUGH
 THOSE
 WHO
 KNEW
 HIM
 WOULD
 HARDLY
 DOUBT
 FOR
 A MOMENT
 THAT
 HE WAS
 STIFF
 AND
 FILLED
 WITH
 AN UNBEARABLE
 SADNESS-THE
 SADNESS
 OF THE
 WOLF
 SOUL
 MOVING
 WITH
 THE
 PACK,
 DRIVEN
 BY THE
 INSTINCT
 OF SURVIVAL
 AND
 THE
 NATURE
 OF HIS
 OWN
 NATURE-GUARDIANSHIP,
 RITUAL,
 LOYALTY,
 AND
 SPIRIT! 
JENNY
 MAGOOD
 WOULD
 HAVE
 LAUGHED
 AT ANY
 OTHER
 BOY
 AND
 DECIDED
 THAT
 HE WAS
 HITTING
 ON HER,
 BUT
 SHE
 STILL
 OWED
 PART
 OF HER
 OWN
 SURVIVAL
 TO ELIZANDER,
 WHO
 HAD
 SECRETLY
 HELPED
 HER
 MAKE
 CONTACT
 WITH
 VARIOUS
 ADOPTIVE
 PARENTS,
 AND
 SO SHE
 GAVE
 HIM
 A FRANK
 AND
 FRIENDLY
 ANSWER
 ABOUT
 THE
 PROSPECTS
 OF HER
 LATER
 LIFE
 AND
 FINDING
 HER
 PLACE
 IN SOCIETY: 
- YES, THIS
 IS ACTUALLY
 THE
 COUNTRY
 RESIDENCE
 OF MY NEW
 GUARDIAN,
 MR.
 EDMU
ND65, WHICH
 IS LOCATED
 IN GOLD LAKE
 -A
 PRETTY
 COOL
 AND
 PEACEFUL
 PLACE.
 IT'S
 WHERE
 HE'S
 STAYING
 TO REST
 AFTER
 ALL THE
 STUFF
 THAT'S
 GOING
 ON WITH
 THE
 INDUSTRY
 HIS
                                                
 65  Edmund means defender. 
331 
 BUSINESS
 IS IN - 3D PRINTING
 HOUSES
 THAT
 SELL
 LIKE
 HOT
 BREAD.
 DID
 YOU
 KNOW
 THAT,
 WITH
 GOOD
 MAINTENANCE,
 SPECIALISTS
 GIVE
 THEM
 A LIFE SPAN
 OF FIFTY
 TO SIXTY
 YEARS?
 THE
 COMPETITION
 IN THIS
 SECTOR
 IS HUGE.
 MAY
BE THAT'S
 WHERE
 I'LL
 FINALLY
 FIND
 SOME
 SEMBLANCE
 OF A HOME.
 YOU
 WILL
 MISS
 NOT
 ME, NOT
 SO MUCH
 MY IMAGE,
 BUT THE
 EMOTION,
 THE
 FEELING,
 THE
 SMELL
 OF YOUTH
 AND
 UNCERTAINTY
 THAT
 WAS
 ASSOCIATED
 WITH
 ME, AND
 THAT
 IS DIFFERENT.
 THIS
 WHOLE
 UNIVERSE
 IN WHICH
 WE BOTH
 EXISTED,
 TWO
 DOOMED
 SOULS
 CRAVING
 PEACE.
 IN FACT,
 AFTER
 SOME
 OTHER
 DAY
 OR OTHER,
 I WILL
 BE BUT A PALE
 SHADOW
 AND
 AN ANNOYING
 MEMORY
 - NOTHING
 MORE.
 BUT
 THERE
 WAS
 DEFINITELY
 SOMETHING
 NOSTALGIC
 ABOUT
 YOU
 - SOMETHING
 THAT
 REMINDED
 ME OF MYSELF
 IN THE
 BEGINNING,
 WHEN
 I WAS
 BEING
 FUCKED
 BY THE
 STORM
 OF LIFE,
 AND
 YOU
 APPEARED
 QUITE
 BY CHANCE
 AND FOR SOME
 UNKNOWN
 AND
 COMPLETELY
 ILLOGICAL
 REASON
 GAVE
 ME YOUR
 HAND EVEN THOUGH
 YOU
 OWED
 ME ABSOLUTELY
 NOTHING.
 MAYBE
 YOUR
 OWN
 SURVIVAL
 HAD
 SOMETHING
 TO DO WITH
 ME - I DON'T
 KNOW,
 BUT I'M
 NOT
 GOING
 TO LOOK
 THAT
 DEEP
 FOR
 THE
 ANSWER
 EITHER
 - IN THIS
 WHOLE
 UNIVERSE
 THAT
 ... 
- "IT'S
 THE
 WOLF
 MOON,
 AND
 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
 SOMEONE
 IS WATCHING
 US,"
 SAID
 ELIZANDER
 THOUGHTFULLY,
 "BUT
 I WAS
 STILL
 OBLIGED
 TO COME
 AND
 SEE WHAT
 HANDS
 YOU
 WERE
 IN - NOTHING
 PERSONAL.
 I HOPE
 YOU
 REMEMBER
 THAT
 MAGICAL
 PROTECTION
 I TAUGHT
 YOU
 TO AVOID
 OBSERVATION,
 AS I SUSPECT
 THAT
 PURELY
 AND
 SIMPLY
 SOME
 TIME
 TRAVELER
 WILL
 SOONER
 OR LATER
 BECOME
 INTERESTED
 IN SOMETHING
 RELATED
 TO US - IT'S
 EVEN POSSIBLE...
 I KNOW
 THE
 METHOD
 OF LOCKING
 THE
 FIELD
 IS ELEMENTARY
 AND
 ALL.
 FURTHERMORE,
 WE 332 
 CAN
 ALSO
 USE
 SO CALLED
 NESTED
 RINGS
66, TO STRENGTHEN
 OUR
 ENERGY
 PROTECTION
 FURTHER." 
JENNY
 IMMEDIATELY
 CROSSED
 HER
 ARMS
 AND
 LEGS,
 THUS
 LOCKING
 IN HER
 BIOFIELD,
 THEN
 PERFORMED
 THE
 REST
 OF THIS
 SYMBOLIC
 RITUAL,
 WHICH
 COULD
 HAVE
 BEEN
 COMPLETELY
 UNNECESSARY,
 AND
 YET
 - SHE
 TRUSTED
 BARNAYNE
'S INTUITION
 - THIS
 STREET
 DOG
 HAD
 SURVIVED
 ON A HAIR'S
 BREADTH
 ALL
 HER
 LIFE. 
- "ARE
 WE THAT
 IMPORTANT

 JENNY
 NODDED
 RATHER
 SERIOUSLY,
 AGREEING
 WITH
 HIS
 POSITION,
 "WILL
 ANYONE
 REMEMBER
 US?
 HUMAN
 MEMORY
 IS SO PERISHABLE
 AND
 NOT
 EVEN WORTH
 DESCRIBING
 AT ALL, YET
 IT IS AMAZING. 
- "I
 HOPE
 WE SEE THE
 SUN
 ONE
 LAST
 TIME,
 AND
 THAT
 IT IS NOT
 THE
 SUNSET
 OF OUR
 JOURNEY,"
 BARNAYNE
 WHISPERED
 SOFTLY.
 - "WHO
 KNOWS
 IT MIGHT
 EVEN
 BE THE
 BEGINNING
 OF IT!" 
- "AT LEAST
 THIS
 UNIQUE
 MOMENT
 WAS
 ALL
 OURS,"
 SHE
 MURMURED
 SOFTLY
 WITH A LITTLE
 NOSTALGIA,
 "AND
 NO ONE
 CAN
 TAKE
 IT AWAY
 FROM
 US!
 AND
 MAYBE
 I REALLY
 DID
 LOVE
 YOU
 - JUST
 AS I LOVED
 MYSELF
 AND
 MY OWN
 EXISTENCE,
 AND
 MAYBE
 EVEN MUCH,
 MUCH
 MORE!" 

BOTH
 OF THEM
 HAD
 YET TO DIVE
 AGAIN
 INTO
 THE
 STORMY
 SEA OF LIFE.
 THEY
 HUGGED
 EACH
 OTHER
 GOODBYE.
 JUDY RELAXED
 HER
 HEAD
 ON HIS
 SHOULDER,
 HER
 HAIR
 DISHEVELED,
 BLENDING
 INTO
 THE
 BLACK
 TONE
 OF EVERYTHING
 AROUND
 HER. 
THEN
 THE
 SCENE
 ABRUPTLY
 CHANGED
 AND
 BARNAYNE
 WAS
 SOMEWHERE
 AROUND
 HER
 ORPHANAGE.
 HIS
 BUILDING
 LOOKED
 HELLISHLY
 EMPTY-ALMOST
 UNINHABITABLE.
 IT WAS
 ACTUALLY
 SO STRANGE
 FOR SUCH
 AN INSTITUTION.
 HAD
 TRAVELED
 MORE
 THAN
 A                                                
 66 This is an ancient Indian technique for magical protect
ion. 
333 
 THOUSAND
 MILES
 BECAUSE
 HE HAD
 A PURPOSE
 TO LIVE
 FOR - TO REDISCOVER
 HIMSELF.
 AND
 THEN
 HE BEGAN
 HIS
 NEW
 LIFE
 ON FELISTER
'S FARM-THE
 HELL
 OF HIS
 NEW
 MASTER
 AND
 FATHER.
 BUT
 THERE
 HE FELT
 OUT
 OF PLACE! 

SAW,
 TOO,
 THE
 CO-OPERATION
 BETWEEN
 THE
 GIRL
 AND
 ELIZANDER
 IN THE
 DISPOSAL
 OF THE
 GOODS.
 EXPERIENCED
 MADAME
 AS SHE
 WAS,
 JENNY
 NEVER
 MARRIED-
AS IF SHE
 HAD
 BEEN
 DUMBFOUNDED
 BY HER
 ENCOUNTER
 WITH
 BARNAYNE,
 OR SOMETHING
 ELSE.
 BUT SHE
 HAD
 AMASSED
 AN ENVIABLE
 FINANCIAL
 FORTUNE
 - SHE
 HAD
 EVEN COMMISSIONED
 SOME
 MEMBERS
 OF RIVAL
 ORGANISATIONS
 ON BEHALF
 OF FELISTER,
 WHICH
 MADE
 HER
 SOMETHING
 OF HIS
 AGENT,
 AND
 HER
 VERY
 NAME
 INSPIRED
 AWE
 AND
 RESPECT. 
THE
 MEMORIES
 LINED
 UP BEFORE
 AGENT
 MORALES'
 EYES. TIME-TRAVELLER,
 HE SOON
 FELT
 A STRANGE
 INFLUENCE
 UPON
 HIS
 OWN
 THOUGHTS-
AS IF FELISTER
 HIMSELF
 WANTED
 TO DRIVE
 HIM
 TO THE
 GRAVE. 
HE ALSO
 SAW
 THE
 GRAVE
 OF JAKE
 HIMSELF,
 WHOM
 DIEGO
 HAD
 UNEARTHED
 - AND
 THEN
 HE AND
 HIS
 TEAM
 HAD
 PERSONALLY
 TAKEN
 HIM
 TO
 A SECRET
 LOCATION
 WHERE
 HE WAS
 GIVEN
 FIRST
 AID
 SO THAT
 HE COULD
 TESTIFY
 LATER.

 PERCEPTION
 OF THE
 TIME
 FLOW.
 IT WAS
 ALSO
 THE
 334 
 BEGINNING
 OF A MAGICIAN'S
 TRUE
 AWAKENING
 TO HIS
 JOURNEY
 AS WELL
 AS TO THE
 NATURE
 OF WHAT
 WAS
 GOING
 ON AROUND
 HIM.
 THE
 CORRELATION
 BETWEEN
 SCIENCE
 AND
 THE
 TRANSCENDENT
 IN THIS
 RESPECT
 WAS
 MAINLY
 IN THE
 FACT
 THAT
 IT WAS
 NOT
 THE
 UNITS
 OF MEASUREMENT
 THAT
 WERE
 A FACTOR
 FOR TIME
 ITSELF,
 BUT
 ITS
 SATURATION
 WITH
 EVENTS,
 WHICH
 IN TURN
 MEANT
 THAT
 WITH
 MORE
 EVENTS
 EXPERIENCED,
 MORE
 SUBJECTIVE
 TIME
 SHOULD
 HAVE
 PASSED.
 MANY
 DIFFERENT
 METHODS
 EXISTED
 FOR
 THIS
 PURPOSE
 - BUT THE
 ONE
 WHERE
 THE
 RELEVANT
 DISTINCTION
 WAS
 MADE
 BETWEEN
 SO-CALLED
 SUBJECTIVE
 TIME,
 WHERE
 THE
 MAGE
 WAS
 ABLE
 TO DETERMINE
 HIS
 OWN
 POSITION
 AND
 HAD
 A KEEN
 EYE FOR ALL
 THOSE
 ANOMALIES
 THAT
 DISTORTED
 THE
 FLOW
 OF TIME
 WAS
 GENERALLY
 THE
 STARTING
 POINT
 FOR
 MOST
 TIME
 TRAVEL
 - SOME
 OF WHICH
 COULD
 END
 UP BEING
 TRULY
 CATASTROPHIC. 
THERE
 WERE,
 HOWEVER,
 A FEW
 SERIOUS
 PROBLEMS
 IN MAKING
 THE
 JOURNEY
 IN QUESTION.
 THERE
 WAS
 A SO-CALLED
 TIME
 POLICE
 THAT
 COULD
 PREVENT
 SOME
 OF THESE
 MANIPULATIONS,
 AND
 IT CONSISTED
 OF
 OTHER
 PEOPLE
 WITH
 MAGICAL
 KNOWLEDGE
 WHO
 COULD
 EASILY
 SENSE
 THE
 VIBRATIONS
 INVOLVED,
 AS THEY
 WERE
 AWARE
 OF WHAT
 AND
 WHERE
 TO LOOK.
 IN THE
 METHODOLOGY
 OF SO-CALLED
 VISUALIZATION,
 THE
 MAGICIAN
 HAD
 TO MEMORIZE
 VERY
 PRECISELY
 ALL
 THE
 DETAILS
 OF A GIVEN
 PLACE
 AND
 KEEP
 IN MIND
 THAT
 NEXT
 TIME
 THEY
 MIGHT
 NOT
 BE THERE,
 OR THERE
 MIGHT
 BE SOMETHING
 ELSE
 THAT
 WAS
 ALSO
 TOO SPECIFIC.
 FOR EXAMPLE,
 IF HE WANTED
 TO SUCCESSFULLY
 MANAGE
 HIS
 JOURNEY
 TO A PLACE,
 THE
 MAGE
 SIMPLY
 HAD
 TO IMAGINE
 ITS
 OUTLINE
 IN GENERAL
 TERMS,
 AND
 THEN
 ADD
 DETAILS,
 WHICH
 WAS
 ONE
 OF MANY
 OPTIONS
 IN THIS
 REGARD.
 THE
 MOST
 CRUCIAL
 POINT
 IN THIS
 TECHNIQUE
 WAS
 THE
 ABILITY
 TO HOLD
 THE
 CONSTRUCTED
 IMAGE
 IN THE
 MIND
 LONG
 ENOUGH
 TO ACHIEVE
 THE
 DESIRED
 MAGICAL
 EFFECT.
 THIS
 WAS
 335 
 ALSO
 EXTREMELY
 USEFUL
 FOR
 ASTRAL
 TRAVEL,
 WHICH
 BELONGED
 TO SPACE
 TRAVEL. 
BUT IN GENERAL,
 SOME
 OF THE
 MAGES
 DIDN'T
 DARE
 TO GO TOO FAR
 AND
 DIDN'T
 HAVE
 THE
 KNACK
 FOR SUPER-
SOPHISTICATED
 REALITY
 CONTROL,
 WHICH
 WOULD
 MEAN
 THAT
 WITH
 REALLY
 BOLD
 MANIPULATIONS
 OF TIME,
 A SUBSTANTIAL
 AMOUNT
 OF TIME-SPACE
 PARADOXES
 COULD
 ACCUMULATE,
 WHICH
 WERE
 TO THE
 MAGE'S
 DETRIMENT
 AND
 AFFECTED
 AND
 TAXED
 HIS
 PSYCHE
 CONSIDERABLY,
 AND
 ALSO
 HE HIMSELF
 COULD
 BE ERASED
 THE
 NEXT
 TIME
 REALITY
 CHANGED.
 THE
 SUBTLE
 POINT
 IN CALCULATIONS
 OF ANY
 ORDER
 WAS
 TO TAKE
 MORE
 SIGNIFICANT
 PERIODS
 OF TIME
 - IT WAS
 RATHER
 POINTLESS
 TO CHANGE
 THE
 MAGICIAN'S
 PERCEPTIONS
 IN JUST
 A FEW
 SECONDS,
 WHICH
 WOULD
 LATER
 BE BURDENED
 BY THE
 ALTERED
 PERCEPTION,
 TIME
 CHANGED
 SUBJECTIVELY,
 AND
 HENCEFORTH
 THEIR
 CHANGE
 IN THE
 FUTURE
 WOULD
 BE EVEN
 MORE
 COMPLICATED.
 YES,
 THE
 MAGICIAN
 COULD
 ALSO
 LIFT
 A FEW
 SECONDS
 AND
 MAKE
 A FULL
 RESTORATION
 OF EVENTS,
 BUT
 THE
 PARADOX
 AND
 FATE
 BROUGHT
 ABOUT
 BY HIS
 INTERVENTION
 COULD
 MAKE
 THAT
 TASK
 MORE
 DIFFICULT
 AND
 CAUSE
 UNPREDICTABLE
 RESULTS
 IN THE
 FUTURE,
 AND
 THAT
 CARRIED
 RISKS.
 THE
 ULTIMATE
 MASTERY
 IN THE
 USE
 OF TIME
 MAGIC,
 AS OF ANY
 OTHER
 MAGIC,
 WAS
 THE
 COMBINATION
 OF THE
 TWO
 - AND
 WHILE
 THIS
 SOUNDED
 TOO SIMPLE
 IN THEORY,
 IN PRACTICE
 IT WAS
 A MATTER
 OF LIFE
 AND
 DEATH,
 AND
 VERY
 OFTEN
 ONE
 HAD
 TO ACT
 BLINDLY
 WITH
 THE
 KNOWLEDGE
 AND
 SKILLS
 AT ONE'S
 DISPOSAL,
 AND
 ALSO
 WITH
 THE
 PARTICULAR
 SITUATION
 ALREADY
 BURDENED
 BY MAGICAL
 MANIPULATIONS.
 THE
 MAGICIAN
 WORE
 A SENSE
 OF D336 
 ONE-SIDED
 PERCEPTION
 OF THE
 CRAZY
 UNIVERSE,
 SINCE
 EVEN THOSE
 WHO
 WERE
 PROPONENTS
 OF THIS
 IDEA
 COULD
 NOT
 DENY
 THE
 FACT
 THAT
 THE
 CORRESPONDING
 EDDIES,
 STREAMS
 AND
 BRANCHES
 OF THE
 FLOW
 WERE
 MUCH
 MORE
 NUMEROUS
 AND
 VARIABLE
 THAN
 EVEN THE
 WILDEST
 HUMAN
 IMAGINATION
 WAS
 CAPABLE
 OF ASSUMING
 THEM
 TO BE.
 AFTER
 ALL,
 IT ALL
 BEGAN
 WITH
 THE
 AWARENESS
 OF THE
 MEANING
 OF THE
 MAIN
 STREAM,
 AND SUBSEQUENTLY
 THE
 UPPER
 LEVEL
 OF MANIPULATION
 WAS
 THE
 TRANSFER
 OF IT TO THE
 OTHERS.
 IN A MORE
 COMPLEX
 REALITY,
 A TRULY
 SKILLED
 MAGICIAN
 COULD
 DIVIDE
 TIME
 INTO
 SEVERAL
 TIME
 STREAMS
 AND
 EXERT
 A SPECIFIC
 DEGREE
 OF MANIPULATION,
 BUT
 THIS
 WAS
 ALSO
 EXTREMELY
 DANGEROUS
 AND
 NOT
 AT ALL
 ADVISABLE.
 SOME
 OF THE
 HIGHER
 MAGES
 WERE
 ABLE
 TO DROP
 A SO-CALLED
 TIME-SPACE
 THREAD
 FOR THEMSELVES
 THAT
 WOULD
 HELP
 THEM
 TRAVEL
 INTO
 THE
 PAST
 AND
 FUTURE
 PROVIDED
 THEY
 HAD
 DROPPED
 ANCHOR
 IN THE
 PRESENT,
 BUT
 TRAVELING
 INTO
 THE
 FUTURE
 TOOK A CERTAIN
 RISK,
 BUT TRAVELING
 INTO
 THE
 PAST
 WAS
 CONSIDERABLY
 MORE
 DANGEROUS.
 THE
 MERE
 EXPANSION
 OF SUBJECTIVE
 TIME
 TO EVEN JUST
 A SINGLE
 TIME
 STREAM
 COULD
 PRODUCE
 EXTREMELY
 POWERFUL
 EFFECTS.
 IT WAS
 ALSO
 POSSIBLE
 TO CREATE
 A SO-CALLED
 "TIME
 PAUSE"
 WHERE
 THE
 VICTIM
 WAS
 LOCKED
 WITHOUT
 EVEN NOTICING
 THE
 SNEAK
 ATTACK
 BY THE
 ONE
 WHO
 HAD
 CAST
 THE
 CORRESPONDING
 MAGICAL
 EFFECT.
 BUT
 IT WAS
 THIS
 SPECIFIC
 FORM
 OF MANIPULATION
 THAT
 AGENT
 MORALES
 WAS
 EXPERIENCING. 
THE
 FBR
 INVESTIGATOR
 WHO
 WAS
 IMMERSED
 IN THIS
 WORLD
 FELT LIKE
 A SCHOOLBOY
 WHO
 COULD
 DO NOTHING
 BUT
 TRY
 TO FLUSH
 HIMSELF
 OUT
 THERE.
 TO SLIP
 BETWEEN
 TEMPORAL
 AND
 SPATIAL
 INTERCONNECTIONS
 AND
 FELT
 AS IF HE WAS
 BEING
 SQUEEZED
 BY SOME
 VISE,
 BUT
 HE WAS
 SURE
 HE HAD
 TO FIND
 SOME
 DEFINITE
 ANSWER
 OR TO UNDERSTAND
 THE
 337 
 DESIGN
 OF WHOEVER
 HAD
 PUT
 HIM
 INTO
 THIS
 PERVERSE
 AND
 SELF-CLOSING
 SCENARIO. 
HE WAS
 ACUTELY
 AWARE
 THAT
 BARNAYNE
 HAD UNWITTINGLY
 OR DELIBERATELY
 CAUGHT
 HIM
 IN THIS
 TIME-SPACE
 TRAP,
 AND
 HE NEEDED
 TO UNCOVER
 THE
 COMPLEX
 INTERRELATIONSHIPS,
 AND
 PERHAPS
 EVEN CHAN
GE SOME
 OF THE
 EVENTS
 AS WELL
 AS THEIR
 SEQUENCE.
 BUT
 THAT
 WAS
 WHY
 A MAGE
 HAD
 TO HAVE
 WHAT
 WAS
 CALLED
 MAGICAL
 WEIGHT,
 AND
 HE WAS
 THROWN
 IN LIKE
 A NEWLY
 SIGHTED
 BLIND
 MAN,
 AND
 IT WAS
 AS IF THE
 INVISIBLE
 CHRONOMETER
 HAD
 BEEN
 ACTIVATED
 - HE WAS
 TRAPPED
 IN HIS
 OWN
 MIND
 AND
 HAD
 TO TRY
 TO SURVIVE.
 HE ALSO
 REALIZED
 SOMETHING
 ELSE
 - THE
 MOST
 IMPORTANT
 PART
 OF THE
 FELISTER
'S LEGACY
 WAS
 HIS
 VERY
 SURVIVAL,
 AND
 NOW
 AGENT
 MORALES
 WOULD
 FEEL
 THE
 CIRCLE
 TIGHTENING
 AROUND
 HIM
 FOR HIMSELF.
 BUT
 HOW
 MUCH
 TIME
 WAS
 THERE? 

AT THAT
 CRITICAL
 MOMENT,
 AGENT
 MORALES'
 SUBCONSCIOUS
 KICKED
 IN - HE WAS
 LIKE
 A CAGED
 TIGER
 THAT
 NEEDED
 TO BREAK
 FREE.
 AND
 EVERY
 HUMAN
 SUBCONSCIOUS
 HAD
 THE
 MARVELOUS
 PROPERTY,
 UPON
 PERCEIVING
 AN IDEA,
 OF PUTTING
 IT INTO
 ACTION
 IMMEDIATELY,
 AS IT WORKED
 BY ASSOCIATION
 AND
 UTILIZED
 EVERY
 BIT
 OF KNOWLEDGE
 THAT
 HAD
 BEEN
 GATHERED
 BY A PERSON
 THROUGHOUT
 HIS
 LIFE
 - SO THAT
 WITHIN
 HIM
 WAS
 LOCKED
 INFINITE
 POTENTIAL.
 THE
 SUBCONSCIOUS
 MIND
 DID
 NOT
 ARGUE
 WITH
 ITS
 POSSESSOR,
 BUT
 ACCEPTED
 WHATEVER
 HE CONSCIOUSLY
 BELIEVED. 
IT OCCURRED
 TO HIM
 THAT
 THE
 CONDITION
 IN WHICH
 THIS
 UNKNOWN
 ADVERSARY
 HAD
 PLACED
 HIM
 WAS
 QUITE
 REMINISCENT
 OF THE
 LOCKED-
IN SYNDROME,
 WHERE,
 AFTER
 CERTAIN
 TYPES
 OF DISEASES
 OF THE
 CENTRAL
 NERVOUS
 SYSTEM
 AND
 THE
 BRAIN,
 A PERSON
 WAS
 UNABLE
 TO REACT
 TO EXTERNAL
 STIMULI
 AND
 COULD
 ONLY
 MOVE
 HIS
 EYES,
 WHICH
 WERE
 HIS
 ONLY
 338 
 CONNECTION
 TO THE
 OUTSIDE
 WORLD.
 IF GUIDED
 BY THIS
 LOGIC,
 HE SHOULD
 HAVE
 SEEN THE
 TRUE
 AND
 BRUTAL
 REALITY,
 NOT
 THE
 ONE
 HE WISHED
 TO SEE
 - THE
 CASE
 WAS
 FAR
 FROM
 COMPLETE. 
FELISTER
'S LIMITED
 TIME
 WAS
 NOT AT ALL
 TO BE UNDERESTIMATED
 - HE HAD
 ACHIEVED
 TOO MUCH
 AND
 HAD
 DEFEATED
 HIS
 ENEMIES. 
THEN
 SUDDENLY
 AGENT
 MORALES
 FELT
 SOMETHING
 STRANGE
 - THE
 PICTURE
 BEFORE
 HIS
 EYES
 CHANGED
 AGAIN
 AND
 HE SAW
 ALL
 THE
 TORTURED
 YOUNG
 REPEAT
 OFFENDERS,
 HOMELESS
 PEOPLE
 AND
 ALL SORTS
 OF OTHER
 BRUTAL
 AND
 PERSPECTIVELESS
 TYPES,
 TOSSED
 ABOUT
 BY THE
 WAVES
 OF LIFE
 AND
 WORKING
 ON FELISTER
'S FARM
 - HE COULD
 READ
 THE
 NOSTALGIC
 SADNESS
 IN THEIR
 EYES FOR A LOST
 PAST
 AND
 A TERRIBLE
 AND
 HOPELESS
 FUTURE
 - PERHAPS
 THE
 ONLY
 BONUS
 THEY
 WERE
 AFFORDED
 BY THEIR
 BRUTAL
 EMPLOYER
 WAS
 THE
 RIGHT
 TO SEE THE
 OCCASIONAL
 RAY
 OF SUNSHINE.
 FAR
 AWAY
 IN THE
 FIELD
 TO THE
 WEST
 HE SAW
 A HUGE
 FIELD
 OF SUNFLOWERS
 - PROBABLY
 PART
 OF THE
 FARM,
 WHICH
 MIGHT
 HAVE
 BEEN
 NECESSARY
 TO FELISTER,
 AS SUNFLOWERS
 WERE
 USED
 AS AN INGREDIENT
 IN THE
 PIGS'
 FOOD ALONG
 WITH
 RAPE,
 ALTHOUGH
 FELISTER
 HIMSELF
 HAD
 SOMETIMES
 FED
 THEM
 HUMAN
 FLESH
 AS WELL,
 AND
 USUALLY
 THOSE
 THUS
 KILLED
 DISAPPEARED
 COMPLETELY
 WITHOUT
 A TRACE
 AS THE
 PIGS
 DEVOURED
 EVERYTHING
 - EVEN THE
 BONES
 OF THE
 UNFORTUNATE
 SUFFERERS.
 FELISTER
 HAD
 DONE
 HIS
 SUMS
 WELL,
 SO AS NOT
 TO GO TO UNNECESSARY
 EXPENSE. 

AND
 FOUND
 THAT
 ELIZANDER
 BARNAYNE
 WAS
 THE
 LAST
 REMNANT
 OF FELISTER
'S INHERITANCE.
 IT ALL
 CAME
 INTO
 HIS
 MIND
 LIKE
 D339 
 HE FELT
 LIKE
 AN ALIEN
 IN ANOTHER
 WORLD!
 BECAUSE
 THE
 PEOPLE
 WHO
 HAD
 CROSSED
 OVER
 WOULD
 ALWAYS
 LIVE
 AMONG
 THE
 DIFFERENT
 SCENARIOS
 OF TEMPORAL
 REALITY
 - AND
 PERHAPS
 WOULD
 NEVER
 BELONG
 TO ANY
 OF THEM.
 AND
 IF THEY
 WANTED
 TO BE HAPPY,
 THEY
 HAD
 TO ACCEPT
 THAT
 FACT.
 MAYBE
 IT WAS
 APPROPRIATE
 FOR
 THEM
 TO BE SOMETHING
 LIKE
 MEDIATORS,
 OR TO FIX THIS
 WHOLE
 MESS
 CAUSED
 BY SO MANY
 INSANE
 MAGES
 MANIPULATING
 MATTER
 - AND
 APPARENTLY
 NOT
 IN A VERY
 MORAL
 WAY. 
AS HE WATCHED
 ALL
 THESE
 SCENES,
 REVEALING
 TO HIM
 VARIOUS
 STAGES
 OF HISTORY
 AND
 THE
 GENIUS
 OF FELISTER
'S BEING
 IN SO MANY
 DIFFERENT
 PLACES
 WHILE
 HE WAS
 PRACTICALLY
 BEYOND
 THE
 PHYSICAL
 LAWS
 OF THIS
 WORLD,
 AGENT
 MORALES
67 REALIZED
 THE
 MEANING
 OF THIS
 CURSE
 - FELISTER
 HAD
 PAID
 FOR IT WITH
 HIS
 OWN
 SOUL. 
HE REMEMBERED
 HIS
 DIVORCE
 FROM
 HIS
 WIFE,
 WHO
 HAD
 GONE
 IN AN UNKNOWN
 DIRECTION
 WITH
 SOME
 ONE
 WHO
 WAS
 MUCH
 YOUNGER
 THAN
 HERSELF
 AND
 COULD
 HARDLY
 OFFER
 HER
 A MORE
 SERIOUS
 FUTURE.
 HE WASN'T
 HANDSOME,
 HE WASN'T
 RICH,
 HE DIDN'T
 EVEN THINK
 IT WAS
 FOR LOVE
 - BUT,
 AGAINST
 ALL
 LOGIC,
 HE DID.
 PERHAPS
 SHE
 HAD
 GROWN
 BORED
 WITH
 THEIR
 THIRTY-FIVE-YEAR
 MARRIAGE,
 OR PERHAPS
 THAT
 WAS
 JUST
 THE
 WAY
 IT WAS
 SUPPOSED
 TO BE!
 HIS
 DAUGHTER
 WAS
 A GIFTED
 STUDENT,
 BUT
 SHE
 WAS
 IN A HURRY
 TO GET
 OUT
 OF THIS
 WASP'S
 NEST
 AND
 SAVE
 HERSELF
 AS QUICKLY
 AS POSSIBLE. 
IT SEEMED
 LIKE
 YESTERDAY
 WHEN
 SHE
 HAD
 TOLD
 HIM
 IN THE
 SERIOUS
 TONE
 OF AN ADULT: 
                                               
 67 Morales means the son of morality or simply morality, but 
at 
the same time it is also associated with the mulberry 
fruit, which 
symbolizes spiritual neglect and ignorance. 
340 
 - DADDY,
 I DON'T
 BELONG
 TO YOU,
 WE LIVE
 IN DIFFERENT
 WORLDS,
 AND
 THERE'S
 JUST
 NO ROOM
 FOR
 ME IN YOURS.
 I'LL
 CHOOSE
 REAL
 LIFE,
 AND
 IF I CAN
 OUTGROW
 MYSELF,
 I WILL,
 IF NOT,
 I'LL
 JUST
 DIE. 
THEN
 HE FELT
 A STRANGE
 FEELING,
 FOR
 SHE
 HAD REVEALED
 THE
 SECRET
 THAT
 HE HAD
 SO CAREFULLY
 KEPT
 FROM
 HER,
 THAT
 HE WAS
 SIMPLY
 DOING
 HIS
 DUTY
 AS A PARENT
 - AND,
 WELL,
 PERHAPS
 HE HAD
 SOME
 SYMPATHY
 FOR HER,
 FOR
 HER
 TALENTS
 SEEMED
 REALLY
 PROMISING,
 AND
 SHE
 WAS
 SUCH
 A WELL-
MANNERED
 AND
 SWEET
 YOUNG
 LADY,
 BUT
 HE HAD
 NEVER
 FELT
 A FATHER'S
 LOVE
 FOR
 HER
 - NOT
 EVEN SINCE
 SHE
 WAS
 BORN.
 HE COULDN'T
 REMEMBER
 HIS PARENTS
 HAVING
 FELT
 IT FOR
 HIM
 EITHER
 - HE'D
 BEEN
 SENT
 TO THE
 FBR
 ACADEMY
 RIGHT
 OUT
 OF COLLEGE,
 AND
 FROM
 THERE
 ON HIS
 LIFE
 HAD
 BEEN
 TEXTBOOK. 
HIS
 DAUGHTER
 WAS
 BEAUTIFUL
 AND
 EVEN ATTRACTIVE
 - UNLIKE
 HIS
 OWN
 WIFE,
 WHO
 WAS
 RATHER
 MEDIOCRE.
 THEY
 WERE
 LIKE
 TWO DIFFERENT
 UNIVERSES.
 HER
 NAME
 WAS
 AZARYA
68. MAYBE
 IF HE HAD
 MARRIED
 SOMEONE
 LIKE
 HER
 ONCE,
 EVERYTHING
 WOULD
 BE DIFFERENT
 NOW
 - AND
 IT WOULDN'T
 HAVE
 COME
 TO THIS
 STRANGE
 COINCIDENCE
 AND
 ALL
 THESE
 PROBLEMS
 IN HIS
 PERSONAL
 LIFE. 
APPARENTLY
 SHE
 HAD
 GROWN
 UP BEFORE
 HE KNEW
 IT AND
 BY THE
 TIME
 HE HAD
 TURNED
 AROUND
 AND
 HIS
 LIFE
 HAD
 GONE
 ON IN A VERY
 SAD
 AND
 SLOW
 WAY.
 AND
 THIS
 PARENT'S
 READINESS
 WAS
 LINKED
 TO AN EXISTENTIAL
 CRISIS,
 AND
 WASN'T
 INTERNAL
 CONNECTEDNESS
 MUCH
 MORE
 IMPORTANT
 AND
 WHY
 WAS
 EXTERNAL
 EXPRESSION
 NECESSARY
 AT ALL?
 AGENT
 MORALES
 - THE
 GUARDIAN
 OF THE
 LAW!
 ONE
 WHO
 HAD
 SUCCEEDED
 WHERE
 MANY
 OTHERS
 HAD
 FAILED.
 HIS
 THOUGHTS
 WERE
 DEFINITELY
 GOING
 IN A STRANGE
 DIRECTION,
 BUT
 THE
 FED
 REALIZED
 - THE
 TIME
 SCENARIO,
 OR MORE
                                                
 68 The name Azarya means assisted by God. 
341 
 ACCURATELY
 THE
 TIME
 PAUSE
 HE WAS
 LOCKED
 IN,
 WAS
 MAKING
 HIM
 FEEL
 EXTREMELY
 STRANGE.
 IT WAS
 AS IF HIS
 BODY
 HAD
 BEEN
 PLACED
 IN A SPECIFIC
 VACUUM,
 AND
 THE
 TOTALITY
 OF THE
 ACCUMULATED
 TIME-SPACE
 PARADOXES
 WAS
 PUSHING
 HIM
 TO CRUSHING.
 AS IF HE HAD
 TO RELIVE
 ALL
 THIS
 SUFFERING
 OVER
 AND
 OVER
 AGAIN
 IN A NEVER-ENDING
 CYCLE.
 WHOEVER
 HAD
 CAUGHT
 HIM
 IN THIS
 TRAP
 WAS
 BEATING
 HIMSELF
 UP A LOT.
 AND
 HE WAS
 DEFINITELY
 MEAN! 
HE SAW
 ONE
 OF THE
 MEETING
 ROOMS
 AT FBR
 HEADQUARTERS
 IN WASHINGTON.
 THE
 ROOM
 WAS
 SET ASIDE
 FOR SPECIAL
 BRIEFINGS
 AND
 EVEN THE
 ATMOSPHERE
 WAS
 REDOLENT
 OF AN IMPORTANT
 SPEECH
 TO COME.
 HIS
 OWN
 COLLEAGUES,
 WERE
 PRESENT
 AT THE
 SPECIAL
 CEREMONY,
 AND
 THE
 DIRECTOR-GENERAL
 OF THE
 F.B.I.
 HAD
 DISTRIBUTED
 PROMOTIONS
 TO SOME
 OF THEM
 FOR THEIR
 SPECIAL
 SERVICES
 IN UNCOVERING
 THE
 LAUNDERED
 MONEY
 OF THE
 GREEDY
 AND
 BRUTAL
 BREEDER,
 FELISTER
 EMBANKS.
 THOUGH
 THE
 VISION
 WAS
 BURDENED
 BY SOME
 TEMPORAL
 DISTURBANCES,
 STILL
 MORALES
 COULD
 SEE
 EVERYTHING
 CLEARLY
 ENOUGH-
AS THROUGH
 A FOGGED-
UP AUTOMOBILE
 WINDSHIELD,
 WHICH
 HE HAD
 WIPED
 CLUMSILY
 WITH
 THE
 SLEEVE
 OF HIS
 GARME
NT IN ORDER
 TO HAVE
 SOME
 VIEW
 DURING
 HIS
 JOURNEY. 
THE
 WHOLE
 ROOM
 SPARKLED
 IN A FAIRY
 LIGHT
 AND
 HAD
 SOFT,
 PLEASANT
 LEATHER-UPHOLSTERED
 ARMCHAIRS,
 WITH
 A CONFERENCE
 TABLE
 IN THE
 MIDDLE
 OF IT. 
HERE
 WERE
 JEKOVICH,
 THAT
 HYPOCRITICAL
 BLUESTOCKING
 AND
 CRIMINAL
 WHO'D
 EMBEZZLED
 SUBSTANTIAL
 SUMS
 OF MONEY
 FROM
 DRUG CARTELS,
 ERDON
 KNOX
 - HE USUALLY
 HELPED
 VARIOUS
 CORRUPT
 FIGURES
 OF STAR
 STATUS
 SORT
 OUT
 THEIR
 LEGAL
 STATUS
 PROBLEMS
 WHEN
 THEY
 HAD
 CONFLICTS
 OF INTEREST
 - ESPECIALLY
 IF THEY
 WERE
 CAUGHT
 RED-
342 
 HANDED
 AND
 ... BUT THIS
 WAS
 DIEGO
 EMBANKS
 OR...
 NO,
 HIS
 EYES
 WEREN'T
 DECEIVING
 HIM
 AT ALL,
 THOUGH
 THE
 VIEW
 WAS
 HAZY.
 HIS
 HEAD
 WAS
 GOING
 TO EXPLODE.
 HOW
 COULD
 SUCH
 A PARADOX
 HAVE
 HAPPENED. 

AND
 HOW
 DIEGO
69, WHO
 HAD
 DISAPPEARED
 TO WHO
 KNEW
 WHERE,
 AFTER
 HE HAD
 TAKEN
 UP THE
 TASK
 OF COOPERATING
 PHYSICALLY
 HE SHOULDN'T
 HAVE
 BEEN
 THERE
 - THERE
 WAS
 ABSOLUTELY
 NO LOGIC
 IN HIM
 BEING
 ANYWHERE.
 EXISTENCE
 ITSELF
 AS AN IDEA
 HAD
 TO BE A UNIFIED
 WHOLE,
 AND
 COULD
 NOT
 BE MADE
 UP OF DIFFERENT
 PARTS.
 BY THE
 SAME
 LOGIC,
 IF EXISTENCE
 HAD
 NO PARTS,
 IT FOLLOWED
 THAT
 IT HAD
 NO FORM,
 SINCE
 ALL
 FORM
 WAS
 MADE
 OF PARTS.
 AND
 THIS
 SERIOUS
 PROBLEM
 OF SEEKING
 THE
 TRUTH
 OF EXISTENCE
 WAS
 ALSO
 RELATED
 TO THE
 SETTING
 OF BOUNDARIES
 - IF THERE
 WAS
 NO FORM,
 THEN
 THERE
 WERE
 NO BOUNDARIES,
 AND
 IT ALSO
 FOLLOWED
 THAT
 THE ABSENCE
 OF FORM
 WAS
 ALSO
 THE
 ABSENCE
 OF BOUNDARIES,
 BECAUSE
 IT WAS
 THE
 FORM
 THAT
 DEFINED
 THEM.
 IN THE
 SAME
 LINE
 OF THOUGHT,
 EXISTENCE
 SHOULD
 NOT
 HAVE
 BEEN
 DIVIDED
 INTO
 PAST,
 PRESENT
 AND
 FUTURE,
 SINCE
 THEY
 WERE
 AGAIN
 PARTS
 AND
 WERE
 CONTRARY
 TO THE
 VERY
 PRINCIPLE
 OF EXISTENCE.
 IF EXISTENCE
 ITSELF
 COULD
 NOT
 BE FOUND
 ANYWHERE,
 THIS
 WAS
 RELATED
 TO THE
 FACT
 THAT
 IT COULD
 NEVER
 BE FOUND
 IN THE
 SAME
 PLACE.
 IN THIS
 LINE
 OF THOUGHT,
 EXISTENCE
 ITSELF
 WAS
 IN MOTION,
 BUT
 SINCE
 THERE
 IS NOTHING
 BESIDES
 IT IN WHICH
 IT RESIDES,
 MOTION
 ITSELF
 IS NOT
 POSSIBLE.
 CONTINUING
 ALONG
 THIS
 PATH
 OF LOGIC,
 EXISTENCE
 SHOULD
 HAVE
 NO BEGINNING
 BECAUSE
 THERE
 IS NOTHING
 ELSE
 BUT
 IT TO CREATE
 IT.
 ON THE
 OTHER
 HAND,
 IT IS ALSO
 THAT
 IN WHICH
 ALL
 THAT
 IS CREATED
                                                
 69 There is a kind of play on words here with the name Die
go, 
signifying a displacement from reality and on the othe
r learning 
to exist. 
343 
 COMES
 TO PASS,
 AND
 THEREFORE
 IT WOULD
 NEVER
 HAVE
 AN END
 FOR THE
 SIMPLE
 REASON
 THAT
 THERE
 WAS
 NOTHING
 BUT
 IT TO OBLITERATE
 IT.
 EXISTENCE
 ITSELF
 WAS
 EVERYWHERE
 AND
 NOWHERE,
 IT WAS
 MOVING
 BUT
 ALSO
 NOT
 MOVING,
 IT POSSESSED
 NEITHER
 TIME
 NOR
 BOUNDARIES,
 IT WAS
 INFINITE,
 WITHOUT
 BEGINNING
 AND WOULD
 NEVER
 REACH
 ITS END.
 THE
 INEVITABLE
 QUESTION
 AROSE
 AS TO WHETHER
 MAN
 WAS
 EVER CAPABLE
 OF DEVELOPING
 SUCH
 DIVINE
 FACULTIES,
 USING
 A PROPER
 PATH
 OF DEVELOPMENT
 INSTEAD
 OF FALLING
 INTO
 AN IMAGINARY
 STATE
 OF BLISSFUL
 CONTEMPLATION
 OF THE
 KNOWN
 NATURE
 OF
 THE
 PSYCHIC.
 AND
 THIS
 WAS
 THE
 GREAT
 QUESTION
 OF MOVEMENT
 BETWEEN
 SPACE
 AND
 TIME,
 WHERE
 OUR
 SOULS
 HAD
 TO REMAIN
 FOCUSED
 ON TASKS
 RELATED
 TO THE
 VERY
 PURPOSE
 OF OUR
 EXISTENCE. 
AGENT
 MORALES
 REALIZED
 THIS
 VERY
 CLEARLY
 AS HE WATCHED
 THE
 STRANGE
 CEREMONY,
 WHI
CH MIGHT
 HAVE
 SEEMED LIKE
 A FARCE
 TO SOME,
 BUT
 NOT
 TO HIM,
 WHO
 DEEP
 DOWN
 HAD
 SENSED
 THE
 PECULIAR
 INTERCONNECTIONS
 OF EVERYTHING
 THAT
 HAD
 BROUGHT
 HIM
 HERE.
 AND
 PERHAPS
 THAT
 WAS
 WHAT
 FELISTER
 MEANT
 TO TELL
 HIM-
HE HAD
 PURSUED
 HIM
 INTO
 HIS
 HELL,
 ONLY
 TO FIND
 HIMSELF
 IN HIS
 OWN-
ENCLOSED
 IN NOTHING! 
THE
 HEADMASTER
 CAME
 IN,
 AND
 HIS
 SPEECH
 WAS,
 ABOVE
 AND BELOW,
 AS FOLLOWS: 
- YOU
 HAVE
 PROVED
 THAT
 YOU
 CAN
 DO SOMETHING
 NONE
 OF US HAD
 THOUGHT
 POSSIBLE
 - AN INFINITE
 POSSIBILITY
 OF CREATION
 ITSELF! 
AGENT
 MORALES
 WAS
 JUST
 GOING
 TO SCREAM!
 HAD
 EVERYONE
 GONE
 OFF
 THE
 DEEP
 END,
 OR HAD
 HE JUST
 GONE
 BEYOND?
 PERHAPS
 CLARIFYING
 THIS
 QUESTION
 WOULD
 HAVE
 HELPED
 HIM
 AT LEAST
 A LITTLE
 IN ALLEVIATING
 HIS
 OWN
 SUFFERING! 
344 
 - I WOULD
 LIKE
 TO ACKNOWLEDGE
 YOUR
 SERVICES
 FROM
 THE
 BOTTOM
 OF MY HEART,
 AND
 FOR YOUR
 TREMENDOUS
 COOPERATION
 ... 
AGENT
 MORALES
 CAST
 A GLANCE
 AT WHERE
 DIEGO
 WAS,
 BUT
 IT WAS
 EMPTY.
 PERHAPS
 HE HAD
 JUST
 LEFT
 EARLY,
 OR SOMETHING
 HAD
 HAPPENED.
 BUT HE HADN'T
 LOST
 SIGHT
 OF HIM!
 WAS
 IT POSSIBLE!
 HE LOOKED
 AT HIS
 OWN.
 WASN'T
 IT TOO
 OBVIOUS
 THAT
 ...
 YES,
 HIS
 OWN
 PLACE
 WAS
 EMPTY
 TOO,
 BUT
 HARDLY
 ANYONE
 AROUND
 NOTICED
 JUST
 THAT.
 THEY
 WERE
 ALL
 TOO ENTHUSIASTIC,
 OBSERVING
 THE
 COOL
 AND
 PROFESSIONAL
 ETHICS
 OF SPECIAL
 AGENTS
 CHARGED
 WITH
 TOO
 VALID
 AND
 SERIOUS
 FUNCTIONS. 
- I WOULD
 ACTUALLY
 LIKE TO THANK
 AND
 ... AGENT
 MORALES
 HELD
 HIS
 BREATH.
 THE
 FACES
 OF EVERYONE
 PRESENT
 LOOKED
 AS STONY
 AND
 IMPENETRABLE
 AS GRANITE
70. AS IF THEY
 WERE
 IN SOME
 FROZEN
 STATE,
 WAITING
 FOR SOME
 SPECIFIC
 EVENT
 TO ACTIVATE
 THE
 CORRESPONDING
 MAGICAL
 EFFECT.
 THEN
 HE REALIZED
 - THIS
 WAS
 THE
 REVENGE
 OF THE
 DIEGO
 THAT
 WAS
 PART
 OF FELISTER
'S TRUE
 HERITAGE.
 HE WAS
 ABLE
 TO SHIFT
 BETWEEN
 THE
 DIFFERENT
 LAYERS
 OF SPACE-TIME
 REALITY
 IN A WAY
 THAT
 WAS
 ADMIRABLE.
 AND
 YET HAD
 HE PUT
 HIM
 IN THAT
 POSITION?
 AGENT
 MORALES
 HAD
 SOME
 DOUBTS
 ABOUT
 THAT.
 AND
 WHETHER
 TRAVEL
 THROUGH
 SPACE-
TIME
 ITSELF
 WAS
 POSSIBLE
 WITHOUT
 THE
 ACCUMULATION
 OF SPACE-TIME
 PARADOXES,
 OR WHETHER
 THERE
 WAS
 SOME
 INGENIOUS
 MEANS
 BY WHICH
 THE
 TRAVELLER
 COULD
 PURGE
 HIMSELF
 OF THEM
 SO THAT
 THEY
 DID
 NOT
 INTERFERE
 WITH
 AND
 BURDEN HIS
 CONSCIOUSNESS,
 BY WHICH
 HE HAD
 TO EXERCISE
 CONTROL
 OVER
 REALITY.
 AND
 IF DIEGO
 HAD
 MASTERED
 THAT,
 THEN
 HE HAD
 REACHED
 A LEVEL
 THAT
 FELISTER
 EMBANKS
 COULD
 ONLY
 DREAM
 OF. HE COULD
                                                
 70  Granite is associated with strength and perfection. 
345 
 NOT
 ONLY
 GO ANYWHERE
 AND
 EVERYWHERE,
 BUT HE COULD
 PURGE
 HIMSELF
 OF ALL
 THAT
 WEIGHT.
 THERE
 WAS
 A LOT OF SENSE
 IN THAT.
 BUT
 THE
 ISSUE
 HERE
 WAS
 PRIMARILY
 ONE
 OF PERSONAL
 AWARENESS
 OF OUR
 ROLE
 IN THE
 SCHEME
 OF THE
 HIGHER
 UNIVERSAL
 DESIGN.
 THE
 WHOLE
 MEANING
 OF EXISTENCE
 AND
 OF LIFE
 IN GENERAL
 WAS
 EXTREMELY
 RARE
 - WAS
 THAT
 WHAT
 FELISTER
 MEANT?
 DID
 OUR
 CONSCIOUSNESS
 SHED
 LIGHT
 ON THE
 MYSTERIES
 OF THE
 UNIVERSE
 AND
 MAKE
 IT POSSIBLE,
 OR THE
 CONNECTION
 TO THAT
 SAME
 UNIVERSE
 AND
 TO THE
 CREATOR
 HIMSELF?
 YES,
 BE EVIL
 OR BE GOOD,
 BUT
 AT LEAST
 LIVE
 IN THIS
 REALITY
 AND
 AT LEAST
 WHILE
 YOU
 HAVE
 IT
 BEFORE
 YOU
 ARE
 WIPED
 OUT
 THE
 NEXT
 TIME
 IT CHANGES.
 MAYBE
 THAT
 WAS
 FELISTER
'S IDEA
 OR SHOULD
 I HAVE...?
 MAYBE
 THE
 CRASH
 WAS
 GOING
 TO HAPPEN
 SOONER
 OR LATER?
 "WHAT
 IF IT WAS
 ALL
 JUST
 ONE
 GIANT,
 UNIVERSAL
 JOKE

 THOUGHT
 AGENT
 MORALES,
 "AND
 IF WE REALLY
 DIDN'T
 HAVE
 SO MUCH
 TO WORRY
 ABOUT!"
 THIS
 SUDDEN
 THOUGHT
 SEEMED
 TO EASE
 HIS
 MIND,
 AND
 HE LISTENED
 TO THE
 DIRECTOR'S
 SPEECH
 AGAIN: 
- IT'S
 TIME
 TO CHANGE
 POSITIONS,
 BUT
 EVERYTHING
 WILL
 BE BACK
 TO THE
 WAY
 IT WAS.
 I WANT
 TO ...
  WHY
 WAS
 HE INTERRUPTING
 IN THE
 SAME
 PLACE?
 "THIS
 MUST
 BE SOME
 KIND
 OF WORD
 GAME,"
 AGENT
 MORALES
 CONTINUED
 WITH
 HIS
 REASONING,
 "IT
 REMAINS
 FOR
 ME TO FIGURE
 IT OUT!
71" 
BUT HOW
 COULD
 MEMORIES
 BE PRESERVED
 DURING
 TIME
 TRAVEL,
 OR WAS
 IT POSSIBLE
 THAT
 MEMORIES
 COULD
 BE MINED
 IF WE WANTED
 TO PLAY A CONCERNED
 SOUL
 WHO
 WOULD
 WANT
 TO PRESERVE
 HER
 MEMORIES
 IN SOME
 FORM
 AND
 HAVE
 ACCESS
 TO THEM
 LATER
 IN HER
 JOURNEY
 OR FORMALLY
 SPEAKING
 IN HER
                                                
 71 An allusion is made to the Three Yes's associated with 
ultimate power, community and change as expressed by 

renowned blogger Seth Barnes. 
346 
 DEVELOPMENT
 IN SOME
 OTHER
 WORLD
 - SUCH
 SOURCES
 OF MEMORIES
 COULD
 BE ALL
 SORTS
 OF PERFUMES,
 IMAGES
 OR FRAGMENTS
 OF OUR
 LIVES,
 AND
 ALSO
 STORIES
 THAT
 HAUNTED
 OUR
 DREAMS,
 AND
 SOMETIMES
 A SOUL
 NEEDED
 ENOUGH
 MEMORIES
 TO FILL
 HER
 MEMOIR,
 AND
 ALSO
 NEEDED
 TO BE ASSURED
 OF THE
 CORRECTNESS
 OF THE
 MEMORIES
 THEMSELVES
 AND
 TO BE SEPARATED
 FROM
 THE
 CORRESPONDING
 FALSE
 MEMORIES
 THAT
 THE
 STREAMS
 OF MEMORIES
 WERE
 VERY
 IMPORTANT
 - ESPECIALLY
 WHEN
 THEY
 AROSE
 UPON
 ASSOCIATION
 WITH
 THE
 CORRESPONDING
 SOURCE
 OF MEMORIES.
 THE
 MEMORIES
 OF OUR
 PAST
 BAD
 HABITS
 WERE
 LIKE
 MINES
 IMPLANTED
 IN OUR
 CONSCIOUSNESS. 

PERHAPS
 AGENT
 MORALES
 HAD
 TO WALK
 THROUGH
 THE
 ENTIRE
 MINEFIELD
 AND
 REMAIN
 COMPLETELY
 UNSCATHED
 - AND
 WOULD
 HE SUCCEED?
  WOULD
 HE HAVE
 HAD
 THE
 STRENGTH
 TO WITHSTAND
 THIS
 TREMENDOUS
 ONSLAUGHT
 OF NEGATIVE
 ENERGY
 LAID
 DOWN
 BY THE
 MAD
 AND
 RUTHLESS
 BREEDER,
 FELISTER
 EMBANKS? 

AGENT
 MORALES
 HAD
 FAC
ED A LOT OF NEGATIVE
 ENERGY
 IN HIS
 JOURNEY
 TO THE
 TOP.
 SO MANY
 DIFFERENT
 AND
 SPECIFIC
 VIBRATIONS
 HAD
 BEEN
 SET
 IN MOTION
 IN HIS
 ATTEMPTS
 TO ACHIEVE
 PERFECTION
 IN HIS
 PROFESSION.
 THE
 NATURE
 OF NEGATIVE
 ENERGY
 CONSISTED
 OF A FEW
 BASIC
 SYMPTOMS
 THAT
 COULD
 BE EASILY
 DETECTED,
 AND
 USUALLY
 LED
 TO OBSESSION.
 YES, HE HAD
 BEEN
 THROUGH
 HELL
 IN HIS
 LIFETIME. 

AFTER
 LEAVING
 THE
 HOUSE,
 THE
 LATE
 AZARYA
 DIED
 IN A CAR
 ACCIDENT.
 SOME
 CLAIMED
 SHE
 WAS
 VERY
 DRUNK, BUT NO ONE
 DESCRIBED
 THE
 EXACT
 CAUSE
 OF DEATH.
 LATER,
 A MEDICAL
 EXAMINER
 TOLD
 HER
 FATHER,
 UNDER
 A SURROGATE'S
 BREATH,
 THAT
 THE
 PROBABLE
 CAUSE
 WAS
 AN ARTIFICIALLY
 INDUCED
 EMBOLISM
 THAT
 HAD
 FINISHED
 HER
 OFF. IT WAS
 A REAL
 347 
 TRAGEDY.
 EVEN THOUGH
 HE HAD
 NOT
 LOVED
 HER
 IN LIFE,
 HE SIMPLY
 OUT
 OF COWARDLY
 SHAME
 LEFT
 FLOWERS
 ON HER GRAVE.
 SUCH
 WAS
 THE
 ORDER! 
HE REMEMBERED
 HER
 WORDS,
 SPOKEN
 WITH
 INEXPRESSIBLE
 REGRET: 
- PAPA,
 THE
 HOUSE
 IS ASSOCIATED
 WITH
 OUR
 SELF,
 BUT I NEVER
 FELT
 IT AS MY OWN.
 TO ME IT SHOULD
 BE LIKE
 MY MOTHER'S
 WOMB,
 TO WHICH
 I SHALL
 NEVER
 RETURN. 

THESE
 WORDS
 DID
 NOT TOUCH
 HIS
 HEART,
 AND
 AFTER
 THE
 LITTLE
 AND,
 IN HIS
 OPINION,
 QUITE
 WELL-
MANNERED
 AND
 SWEET
 YOUNG
 LADY
 WAS
 GONE,
 IT SEEMED TO MAKE
 NO IMPRESSION
 ON ANYONE.
 ON THE
 DAY
 OF HER
 FUNERAL
 A HEAVY
 RAIN
 WAS
 FALLING,
 AND
 THE
 LONELY
 TOMBSTONE
 SEEMED
 TO RECORD
 ALL
 THE MEANINGLESSNESS
 OF HER
 EXISTENCE.
 AND
 WAS
 HER
 VERY
 EXISTENCE
 REALLY
 COMPLETELY
 MEANINGLESS?
 THE
 QUESTION
 WAS,
 WHAT
 EXACTLY
 WAS
 MEANT
 BY EXISTENCE? 
HER
 FUNERAL
 WAS
 VERY
 MODEST
 AND
 WAS
 NOT
 ATTENDED
 BY ANY
 RELATIVES
 OR FRIENDS
 OF THE
 DECEASED,
 ONLY
 HER
 SOUL
 MATE
 - A COLLEAGUE
 FROM
 THE
 UNIVERSITY
 WITH
 WHOM
 THEY
 HAD
 WORKED
 ON A JOINT
 PROJECT
 FOR
 THE
 PAST
 TWO
 YEARS.
 ONLY
 HE LEFT
 FLOWERS
 TO HONOUR
 HER
 MEMORY. 
- "PERHAPS
 HER
 JOURNEY
 IS JUST
 BEGINNING,"
 REPLIED
 HER
 VISIBLY
 UPSET
 CLASSMATE
72, WHOSE
 NAME
 WAS
 ROGER
 DIDASCO
73. 
                                               
 72 The word student is an acronym, and each of the letters
 in its 
composition stands respectively for learning, truthfulness
, unity, 
discipline, energy, wealth. 
73 Roger Didasco - a play on words that means "Your message 
has been received, learn!" An allusion is made to the circ
le of 
life and how death is an example for the next generat
ion. 
348 
 A LOT
 OF CRIMINALS
 CONSIDERED
 HIM
 A REAL
 DEVIL
 AND
 WISHED
 FOR HIS
 DEATH
 WITH
 ALL
 THEIR
 HEARTS.
 SO HE FELT
 UTTERLY
 CONFUSED
 WHEN
 HE FOUND
 HIMSELF
 CAUGHT
 IN THE
 STRANGE
 TIME-SPACE
 PARADOX,
 SQUEEZED
 INTO
 THE
 TIME
 PAUSE
 IN QUESTION.
 UNTIL
 NOW,
 HE HAD
 BEEN
 THE
 CUSTODIAN
 OF MORALITY,
 BUT
 SUDDENLY
 IT APPEARED
 THAT
 HE HAD
 SEEN ITS
 FLIP
 SIDE
 - ANOTHER
 WORLD
 WHERE
 HE WAS
 TRAPPED
 IN HIS
 OWN
 NIGHTMARES.
 BUT
 SUDDENLY
 HE SAW
 ELIZANDER
 BARNAYNE
 HIMSELF
 BESIDE
 HIM.
 WAS
 IT POSSIBLE?
 WERE
 HIS
 EYES
 NOT
 DECEIVING
 THEMSELVES.
 WAS
 THIS
 A NEW
 TIME
 SPELL,
 DESIGNED
 TO ERASE
 HIM
 FROM
 REALITY? 
BARNAYNE
 STOOD
 WIDE-EYED,
 ARMS
 CROSSED
 IN FRONT
 OF HIS
 POWERFUL
 CHEST.
 HE LOOKED
 CONFIDENT
 AND
 IMPLACABLE.
 AND
 DEVILISHLY
 BLOODTHIRSTY. 

THE
 DETECTIVE
 HAD
 BEEN
 PLACED
 IN THIS
 FROZEN
 TEMPORAL
 STATE
 WHILE
 ELIZANDER
 BARNAYNE,
 WHOSE
 MAGICAL
 POWERS
 WERE
 UNQUESTIONABLE,
 HAD
 GATHERED
 THE
 STRENGTH
 TO DEAL
 WITH
 HIM.
 NOW
 HE CLEARLY
 SENSED
 HIS
 BRUTAL
 DEMONIC
 CAPABILITIES.
 THAT
 THIN
 SCENT
 OF INCENSE,
 THAT
 SMELL
 OF DEATH.
 THERE
 WAS
 NO WAY
 THEY
 COULDN
'T BE SMELLED.
 THOSE
 EYES THAT
 KNEW
 WHAT
 DOOM
 MEANT.
 TIME
 MAGIC
 TRANSPORTED
 HIM
 TO THE
 RUINS
 OF FELISTER
 EMBANX'S
 FARM,
 WHERE
 HE CLEARLY
 SAW
 THE
 SILHOUETTE
 OF HIS
 HIDDEN
 ENEMY.
 A FIERCE
 BATTLE
 BEGAN
 BETWEEN
 THE
 TWO,
 IN WHICH
 ONLY
 ONE
 COULD
 REMAIN. 
BARNAYNE
 DREW
 HIS
 POWERFUL
 PISTOL
 AND
 DRILLED
 THROUGH
 AGENT
 MORALES'
 SKULL
 BEFORE
 HE COULD
 REACT.
 THE
 DETECTIVE
 COLLAPSED
 AND
 BLOOD
 BEGAN
 TO POUR
 FROM
 HIS
 HEAD
 LIKE
 A RED
 INFERNAL
 STREAM,
 WHICH
 IN TURN
 SEEMED TO SEEK ITS
 OWN
 PATH
 BEFORE
 BEING
 SUCKED
 INTO
 THE
 EARTH
 - THE
 ONE
 THAT
 GAVE
 LIFE. 
349 
 BARNAYNE
 SURVEYED
 THE
 BURNT
 REMAINS
 OF FELISTER
'S FARM,
 WHICH
 WERE
 STILL
 WELL
 ENOUGH
 PRESERVED
 AND
 NOT
 YET
 CLEARED
 AWAY
 - NO ONE
 WAS
 EVEN IN THE
 HABIT
 OF WALKING
 THESE
 GROUNDS.
 HE CAST
 A GLANCE
 AT THE
 ABANDONED
 BARN
 AS WELL
 - WHE
RE THE
 INFERNAL
 MANIPULATION
 WAS
 CARRIED
 OUT
 DAILY.
 HE LOOKED
 AROUND
 AT THE
 GREY
 SKY,
 AND
 AT HIMSELF
 IN THE
 REFLECTION
 OF A MUD
 PUDDLE.
 YES, IN ITS
 MIRRORED
 SURFACE
 HE SAW
 HIMSELF
 FOR
 THE
 FIRST
 TIME-
 AS HE TRULY
 WAS. 
HE TURNED
 -BEHIND
 HIM
 WERE
 ARLO
 AND
 ZONARA-
 BOTH
 IN THEIR
 SPIRIT
 FORM.
 THERE
 WAS
 NOT
 A LIVING
 SOUL
 AROUND.
 IT TURNED
 OUT
 THAT
 HE HAD
 BEEN
 COMPLETELY
 ALONE
 THE
 WHOLE
 TIME.
 AND
 HAD TRAVELED
 ALL
 THIS
 DISTANCE
 IN SEARCH
 OF THE
 ANSWER
 TO HIS
 OWN
 EXISTENCE. 
- "EVEN ANGELS
 CAN
 ONLY
 SEND
 YOU
 SO FAR.
 AND EVERY
 MAN
 MUST
 HAVE
 AT LEAST
 ONE
 TO ACCOMPANY
 HIM
 ON HIS
 FINAL
 JOURNEY,
 EVEN
 TWO.
 THESE
 ARE
 THE
 SPIRITUAL
 LAWS
 OF OUR
 WORLD,"
 SAID
 ARLO
 HUMBLY.
 "THIS
 IS OUR
 WORK." 
BARNAYNE
 REMEMBERED
 ALL
 HE HAD
 BEEN
 THROUGH.
 THE
 RUINS
 OF THIS
 WORLD
 REMINDED
 HIM
 OF ANOTH
ER TIME,
 IRRETRIEVABLY
 PAST,
 WHICH
 GAVE
 A PURPOSEFULNESS
 TO HIS
 WHOLE
 BEING.
 THE
 MONOTONOUS
 WAS
 KILLING
 THE
 PIGS!
 SERVICE
 TO HIS
 MASTER!
 WAS
 THIS
 HIS
 LIFE? 
BEFORE
 HE CAME
 TO FELISTER
'S FARM,
 HAVING
 TRAVELLED
 THIS
 VAST
 DISTANCE,
 HE HAD
 STOPPED
 WITH
 BIG
 BROTHER.
 RETRIBUTION
 WAS
 TO BE METED
 OUT! 

IN FACT,
 LIFE
 ON THE
 RESERVE
 HAD
 NOT
 CHANGED
 VERY
 MUCH,
 AND
 EVERYTHING
 WAS
 SO MONOTONOUS-
BUT SOMEWHERE
 IN THERE
 HE REALIZED
 THAT
 BLUEBIRD
 WAS
 ONE
 OF A VANISHING
 SPECIES
 OF 350 
 PEOPLE-ONE
 WHOSE
 EXISTENCE
 WAS
 NOT
 TO BE REPEATED.
 FOR
 GOOD
 OR ILL,
 BIG
 BROTHER
 HAD TO BE REMOVED.
 HE DIDN'T
 EVEN HAVE
 TIME
 TO GASP
 AS THE
 BULLET
 PIERCED
 HIS
 HEART
 AND
 SLOWLY
 DESCENDED,
 REMAINING
 SO - AS IF IN HIS
 SILENT
 SUFFERING
 HE WAS
 UNWILLING
 TO MAKE
 OTHERS
 EMPATHIZE
 WITH
 HIS
 OWN
 PAIN.
 AND
 PERHAPS
 HE WAS
 RIGHT!
 THE
 UNIVERSE
 STOOD
 INDIFFERENT
 TO THIS
 DEATH! 
BARNAYNE
 SAT
 ON THE
 HALF-DESTROYED
 THRESHOLD,
 SEIZED
 WITH
 THOUGHTS
 OF EXISTENCE.
 ALL
 THE
 HALF-
BURNT RUINS
 AROUND
 REMINDED
 HIM
 OF SOME
 BLACK
 MONSTERS
 THAT
 WANTED
 TO GRAB
 HIM,
 BUT
 AT THE
 SAME
 TIME
 THEY
 WERE
 A KIND
 OF SHROUD
 FOR HIM,
 AS THE
 BLACK
 SYMBOLIZED
 EVIL,
 DARKNESS,
 NIGHT
 AND
 DESPAIR
 AND
 HID
 HIM
 FROM
 THE
 REST
 OF THE
 WORLD.
 THE
 NIGHT
 WAS
 BEGINNING
 TO FALL
 AND
 THE
 GLOOM
 AROUND
 MADE
 THEM
 SEEM
 OMINOUS,
 YET
 SOMEHOW
 FLATTERING
 - READY
 TO GIVE
 EVEN
 A TEMPORARY
 DEMONIC
 SHELTER
 TO A LOST
 SOUL.
 AND
 DID
 NOT
 EVIL
 COME
 AT NIGHT,
 AND
 WAS
 IT NOT
 THEN
 AT ITS
 HEIGHT? 
AND
 WHY
 THE
 PARALYZING
 AND
 SLEEPING
 DEMON
 WAS
 STILL
 ABLE
 TO POSSESS
 PEOPLE
 IN THIS
 SO ADVANCED
 HIGH-TECH
 ERA.
 EVERYTHING
 AROUND
 WAS
 DEAD
 - EVEN NATURE.
 AND
 IT SEEMED TO BE FROZEN!
 GONE
 WAS
 THE
 FORMER
 MAD
 CARNAGE,
 BUT ONLY
 VAGUE
 MEMORIES
 OF ALL
 THAT
 VIOLENCE
 THAT
 WAS
 NECESSARY
 TO SUSTAIN
 THIS
 WORLD!
 NO ONE
 HAD
 SEEN THE
 CREATOR,
 BUT
 RECEIVED
 INFORMATION
 ABOUT
 HIM
 FROM
 HIS
 OWN
 EXPERIENCES,
 AND
 HIS
 OWN
 LIFE
 WAS
 ONLY
 FULL
 OF PAIN
 AND
 ENDLESS
 SUFFERING!
 AN UNBEARABLE
 NIGHTMARE,
 FROM
 WHICH
 IT WAS
 HIGH
 TIME
 TO WAKE
 UP! 
WHEN
 DIEGO
 WENT
 TO SEE HIM,
 HE FOUND
 TWO
 CORPSES,
 ONE
 THAT
 OF ELIZANDER,
 THE
 OTHER
 THAT
 OF DETECTIVE
 MORALES.
 WERE
 THE
 ONLY
 LIVING
 ONES
 WHO
 HAD
 SENT
 EACH
 OTHER
 INTO
 THEIR
 DEADLY
 BATTLE.
 DIEGO
 DECIDED
 TO LEAVE
 FLOWERS
 TO 351 
 HONOR
 ELIZANDER
'S MEMORY,
 BUT
 ALSO
 SAW
 FIT
 TO SCATTER
 HIS
 ASHES
 OVER
 HIS
 FINAL
 HOME
 - THE
 FARM
 OF THE
 MAD
 CASTRATOR!
 MORALES'S
 WIFE
 HAD
 LONG
 SINCE
 DIED,
 AND
 THERE
 WAS
 NO ONE
 TO SEND
 HIM
 AWAY
 - BUT HE COULD
 AT LEAST
 COUNT
 ON A SERVICE
 IN THE
 PROPER
 MANNER.
 HE HOPED
 AT LEAST
 THE
 ANGELS
 WOULD
 PEEP IN AND
 ACCOMPANY
 THEM
 BOTH
 TO THE
 END
 OF THEIR
 EARTHLY
 JOURNEY.
 AND
 WHAT
 HAPPENED
 TO ABRAMELIN'S
 GRIMOIRE?
 THAT
 GREAT
 MAGIC
 BOOK!
 WELL,
 IT WAS
 SAFELY
 TUCKED
 AWAY
 BY JAKE
 EMBANKS. 
THE
 TWO
 BROTHERS
 WERE
 ALL
 THAT
 WAS
 LEFT
 OF FELISTER
 EMBANKS'
 VAST
 LEGACY.
 AND
 SOME
 OF THE
 MONEY
 FOR
 THE
 OFFSHORES
 WENT
 TO ORPHANAGES
 - SOME
 PEOPLE
 THOUGHT
 THIS
 SMALL
 GESTURE
 WOULD
 BE A KIND
 OF TRIBUTE
 TO THEIR
 MEMORY. 
THE
 ETERNAL
 WAR
 FOR LIFE
 WAS
 GOING
 ON EVERYWHERE
 AND
 NOWHERE,
 IN MOTION
 AND
 STASIS,
 IN PAST,
 PRESENT
 AND
 FUTURE
 - AN ENDLESS
 CYCLE
 OF SOULS,
 AN ETERNAL
 STRUGGLE
 BETWEEN
 SOUL
 AND
 SPIRIT
 IN THE
 SAME
 BODY
 - A BODY
 THAT
 HAD
 LONG
 SINCE
 CEASED
 TO EXIST
 BECAUSE
 IT HAD
 PASSED
 ON!
 ONCE
 AND
 FOR ALL!
